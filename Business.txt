	This electronic version of the City and County of San Francisco Municipal Code is updated as amending legislation is approved.

	Beginning with ordinances passed in 2011, all ordinances affecting this Code are summarized in a table that lists the identifying information (ordinance and file numbers), effective date, short title, and sections affected for each such ordinance. Users should note that the operative date of an ordinance may be later than the effective date of the ordinance. A delayed operative date will be noted in the ordinance.

Such notes have been inserted by the publisher for the convenience of the user or as historical references. They have not been approved or adopted by the City and County of San Francisco, and are of no legal force or effect.

		(2)	This bond requirement does not apply to an applicant that is a governmental entity. 
		(3)	The Tax Collector may, in his or her discretion, independently establish the annual gross receipts for a parking station and set the bond amount pursuant to the schedule above, based on that determination. If, at the end of any calendar year, the gross receipts for a parking station have increased such that a larger bond amount would be required under the above schedule, the operator shall obtain a new bond in the increased amount by the following April 1. If at the end of any calendar year the gross receipts for the parking station have decreased, the operator may apply to the Tax Collector for a reduction of the bond amount. 
	(i)	Upon application by the operator, the Tax Collector may, in his or her discretion, set the bond amount for a parking station at the following levels, provided the operator meets the following qualifications:  (1) the operator has maintained a valid certificate of authority, including a bond for all locations, for the 3 years immediately preceding the date of the application; (2) the Tax Collector has not issued a deficiency determination against the operator for any business location for the 3 years immediately preceding the date of the application; and (3) the Tax Collector determines that it is in the best interest of the City. The reduced bond amount is applicable during the calendar year that it is approved. The Tax Collector may, in his or her discretion, approve renewal of the bond at the lower amount from year to year. If after approving an application for a reduced bond amount, the Tax Collector issues a deficiency determination against the operator for any business location, or the operator fails to obtain a Certificate of Authority for any business location, the approval may be rescinded and the higher bond amount provided under subsection (h) may be required.

	(j)	Such bond shall be executed by the applicant as principal, and by a corporation or association which is licensed by the Insurance Commissioner of this State to transact the business of fidelity and surety insurance, as surety. The applicant shall keep the bond in full force and effect for the duration of the certificate of authority and all renewals thereof issued to such applicant. If the bond provides that the term thereof shall be continuous until cancelled, the applicant shall provide the Tax Collector with certification from the surety of the renewal or continuation of the bond:
		(1)	when applying for renewal of an existing certificate of authority, 
		(2)	when requesting the withdrawal of a suspension of an existing certificate of authority, 
		(3)	when applying for a reduced bond amount pursuant to subsection (i), or
		(4)	upon written request of the Tax Collector. 
	(k)	The bond shall contain conditions that require the applicant to comply fully with all the provisions of the Business and Tax Regulations Code concerning the collection of third-party taxes from occupants of parking stations and the remittance of such taxes to the Tax Collector. The bond shall be payable to the City in the amount of all unpaid parking taxes on amounts of taxable rents collected by the applicant, together with all administrative collection costs, interest, penalties, and other costs and charges applicable thereto; provided, however, that the aggregate liability of the surety for any and all claims which may arise under such bond shall in no event exceed the face amount of such bond regardless of the amount due and owing to the City. The City may bring an action upon the bond for the recovery of any unpaid parking taxes, administrative collection costs, interest, penalties and other costs and charges at any time prior to the expiration of the period of limitations applicable to the collection of such unpaid taxes by the Tax Collector. 
	(l)	When there is a deficiency determination or jeopardy determination against an operator for third-party taxes, the Tax Collector shall issue the deficiency determination or jeopardy determination against the operator and the operator's surety. The liability of the surety shall not exceed the face value of the bond(s) in effect during the period for which the deficiency is assessed. The Tax Collector shall provide notice of such deficiency determination or jeopardy determination to the operator and the bond surety. Either an operator or a surety or both may file a petition for redetermination. An operator's petition for redetermination shall be construed by the Tax Collector as a petition on behalf of both the operator and the surety. The surety may request a hearing before the Tax Collector pursuant to Section 6.13-2. The taxpayer and surety hearings may be consolidated at the discretion of the Tax Collector. Upon the finality of such determination or decision on petition for redetermination, the operator and the surety shall be liable to the Tax Collector in the amount of the determination or decision on petition for redetermination. The surety's liability shall not exceed the face value of the bond(s) in effect during the period for which the deficiency is assessed. The surety shall be subject to the same requirements as the operator with regard to payment of the tax liability and exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial relief. The Tax Collector may exercise all remedies against the surety that are available to the Tax Collector as to an operator or any other person determined to be liable for a tax. 
	(m)	Before any certificate of authority shall be issued to any applicant to engage in the business of renting parking space in a parking station in this City, the applicant shall comply with Article 22. The applicant shall reimburse the Tax Collector's costs to inspect the parking station to confirm it complies with Article 22.

SEC. 6.7-1.  COLLECTION OF THIRD-PARTY TAXES.
	(a)	(1)	Every operator receiving payment of charges from a customer shall collect the amount of the third-party tax from the customer. All amounts of third-party tax so collected shall be considered to be a special fund in trust for the City. For purposes of this Section, a person who otherwise qualifies as an operator under Section 6.2-13 shall not, by reason of the fact that the person is exempt from the tax, be exempted from the other obligations of an operator, including without limitation the obligation to collect and remit to the City all third-party taxes collected from non-exempt customers. An exemption from a third-party tax is enjoyed by the customer, not by the operator responsible for collecting and remitting such taxes. The operator may not exclude from taxation charges claimed to be exempt unless the operator has records of each transaction, which demonstrate: 
			(A)	the basis for the claim of exemption, and 
			(B)	that an amount was not in fact collected from the exempt customer as a tax. 
		(2)	Where a customer is not the end user of a good or service subject to such tax, the customer shall be deemed an operator. The existence of such deemed operator shall not relieve any other operator of obligations under the Business and Tax Regulations Code, including without limitation the obligation to collect and remit the tax to the City. The liability of such deemed operator and any other operator for the tax, including applicable interest and penalties accrued through the date of payment, shall be joint and several; provided, the City shall be limited to only one satisfaction thereof. 
	(b)	Third-party taxes shall be collected, to the extent practicable, at the same time as and along with the collection of charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the operator. If the amount paid by a customer is less than the full amount of the charges and tax which has accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charges and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. 
	(c)	Where a customer receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period. In all cases of transactions upon credit or deferred payment, the payment of tax to the Tax Collector may be deferred in accordance therewith, and the operator shall be liable therefor at the time and to the extent that such credits are paid or deferred payments are made in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount thereof. 
	(d)	Any third-party tax imposed upon customers shall be deemed a debt owed by the customer to the City. Any such tax required to be collected from customers which has not been remitted to the Tax Collector shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit such tax to the City. 
	(e)	The Tax Collector shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of third-party taxes and such methods and schedules shall provide that the fractional part of 1 cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half of 1 cent or more, in which case the amount (determined without regard to the fractional part of 1 cent) shall be increased by 1 cent. 
	(f)	The Tax Collector may, in the exercise of his or her discretion, require an operator under this Section to maintain trust accounts for deposit of third-party taxes collected from customers. The Tax Collector may direct an operator regarding how such trust accounts shall be created and maintained, and may prescribe the terms of such accounts. An operator's refusal to comply with the Tax Collector's direction regarding a trust account shall be grounds for revocation of a certificate of authority and/or of any license or permit to do business in San Francisco. 
	(g)	When third-party taxes are not paid when due, or when there is any deficiency determination or jeopardy determination against an operator for third-party taxes, the Tax Collector may collect said liabilities, including interest and penalties accrued through the date of payment, from any person or persons the Tax Collector determines was responsible for performing the acts of collecting, accounting for, and remitting third-party taxes to the City and failed to do so, or who had the power to control the financial decision-making process by which the operator allocates funds to creditors in preference to the operator's obligation to remit third-party taxes to the City. When the person or persons responsible for the acts of collecting, accounting for, and remitting third-party taxes to the City cannot otherwise be determined, the Tax Collector may presume the President, Chief Executive Officer, and/or Chief Financial Officer of a corporation or any managing partner or member of an association to be a person responsible for performing such acts. The Tax Collector is authorized to name all such persons potentially responsible for performing such acts in a notice of deficiency determination or jeopardy determination and, in such case, the Tax Collector shall identify the person or persons responsible for such acts in the final decision. The final decision shall be based on the information available to the Tax Collector or based on the above presumption. The liability of such persons shall be joint and several with each other and with the operator, and shall be established in the manner provided for under this Article for other determinations.

SEC. 6.7-2.  REPORTING AND REMITTING THIRD-PARTY TAXES AND STADIUM OPERATOR ADMISSION TAX.
	(a)	All amounts of utility users taxes under Article 10 are due and payable to the Tax Collector for each month on or before the last day of the month immediately following each respective monthly period. All amounts of stadium operator admission taxes under Article 11 are due and payable to the Tax Collector within 5 days after the event, subject to the provisions of Section 804 of Article 11. All amounts of third-party taxes other than the utility users taxes are due and payable to the Tax Collector for each calendar quarter on or before the last day of the month immediately following each respective quarterly period. 
	(b)	On or before the last day of the month immediately following each respective period, every operator except the stadium operator shall file a return for the preceding period with the Tax Collector, on such forms as the Tax Collector may prescribe. Stadium Operators shall file a return within the time periods set forth in Section 804 of Article 11. Filing a return that the Tax Collector determines to be incomplete in any material respect may be deemed failure to file a return in violation of this Section. 
	(c)	Returns shall show the amount of tax required to be collected for the subject period, separately, for each location at which the operator conducts business, and such other information as the Tax Collector requires. The Tax Collector may require returns to show the total number of transactions upon which tax was required to be collected and the amount of tax due on each such transaction, and for each location at which the operator conducts business. The Tax Collector may inspect, examine, and copy records for each such location separately, and may issue deficiency and jeopardy determinations pursuant to this Article for each such location separately, or in combination with one or more other locations at which the operator conducts business. The operator shall file the return, together with remittance of the amount of tax due, with the Tax Collector, at the Tax Collector's Office, on or before the date provided in this Section. Returns and remittances are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. 
	(d)	When a return is filed without full remittance of the amount reported to be due, the amount remaining unpaid, together with any nonpayment penalties, is immediately due and payable and may be collected by the Tax Collector forthwith.

SEC. 6.8-1.  CITY, PUBLIC ENTITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXEMPTIONS.
	(a)	Nothing in Articles 6, 7, 9, 10, 10B, 11, 12, or 12-A shall be construed as imposing a tax upon: 
		(1)	The City;
		(2)	The State of California, or any county, municipal corporation, district or other political subdivision of the State, except where any constitutional or statutory immunity from taxation is waived or is not applicable; 
		(3)	The United States of America, or any of its agencies or subdivisions, except where any constitutional or statutory immunity from taxation is waived or is not applicable; or 
		(4)	Any person exempted from the particular tax by the Constitution or statutes of the United States or the Constitution or statutes of the State of California. 
	(b)	The foregoing exemption from taxation does not relieve an exempt party from its duty to collect, report, and remit third-party taxes.

	(a)	Except as provided in subsection (b) below, on or before the due date, or in the event of a cessation of business within 15 days of such cessation, each taxpayer shall file a return for the subject period on a form provided by the Tax Collector, regardless of whether there is a tax liability owing.

Returns shall show the amount of tax and any third-party tax paid or otherwise due for the related period and such other information as the Tax Collector may require.

 New Ordinance Notice
Publisher's Note: This section has been AMENDED by Proposition E, ratified by the voters at the election on November 6, 2012, and operative on January 1, 2014 (see Prop. E, Secs. 4 and 7). The text of the amendment will be incorporated below when it becomes operative.
	(a)	Prepayments and Remittances. Notwithstanding the due dates otherwise provided in Section 6.9-1, taxpayers shall make prepayments and remittances of taxes and third-party taxes to the Tax Collector as follows: 
		(1)	Hotel and Parking Taxes. The Hotel Tax (Article 7) and the Parking Tax (Article 9) shall be remitted monthly. Such monthly remittances shall be due and payable to the Tax Collector on or before the last day of the month immediately following the month for which such remittance is due. Taxes paid in the first 2 monthly remittances of any quarterly period shall be a credit against the total liability for such third-party taxes for the quarterly period. The third monthly remittance of any quarterly period shall be in an amount equal to the total tax liability for the quarterly period, less the amount of any monthly remittance for such quarter actually paid. 
		(2)	Payroll Expense Tax. The Payroll Expense Tax (Article 12-A) shall be paid in biannual or quarterly installments as follows:
			(A)	Small Firm Prepayments. Every person liable for payment of a total Payroll Expense Tax in excess of $3,750 but less than or equal to $50,000 for any tax year shall pay such tax for the following tax year in 2 installments. The first installment shall be due and payable, and shall be delinquent if not paid on or before, August 1st. The first installment shall be a credit against the person's total Payroll Expense Tax for the tax year in which the first installment is due. The first installment shall be in an amount equal to one-half of the person's estimated Payroll Expense Tax for such tax year. The estimated liability shall be computed by using 52 percent of the person's taxable payroll expense (as defined in Section 902.1 of Article 12-A) for the preceding tax year, and the rate of tax applicable to the tax year in which the first installment is due. The second installment shall be reported and paid on or before the last day of February of the following year. The second installment shall be in an amount equal to the person's total Payroll Expense Tax for the subject tax year, less the amount of the first installment and other tax prepayments for such tax year, if any, actually paid. 
			(B)	Large Firm Prepayments. Every person liable for payment of a total Payroll Expense Tax in excess of $50,000 for any tax year shall pay such tax for the following tax year in 4 quarterly installments. The first, second and third quarterly installments shall be due and payable, and shall be delinquent if not paid on or before, May 1st, August 1st and November 1st, respectively. The first, second and third quarterly installments shall be a credit against the person's total Payroll Expense Tax for the tax year in which such first, second and third quarterly installments are due. Such quarterly installments each shall be in an amount equal to one-quarter of the person's estimated Payroll Expense Tax liability for such tax year. The estimated liability for such tax year shall be computed by using 104 percent of the person's taxable payroll expense (as defined in Section 902.1 of Article 12-A) for the preceding tax year, and the rate of tax applicable to the tax year in which the first, second and third quarterly installments are due. The fourth installment shall be reported and paid on or before the last day of February of the following year. The fourth quarterly installment shall be in an amount equal to the person's total Payroll Expense Tax liability for the subject tax year, less the amount of the first, second and third quarterly installments and other tax prepayments, if any, actually paid. 
	(b)	Tax Prepayment Penalties. Every person who fails to pay any tax prepayment required under this Section before the relevant delinquency date shall pay a penalty in the amount of 5 percent of the amount of the delinquent tax prepayment per month, or fraction thereof, up to 20 percent in the aggregate, and shall also pay interest on the amount of the delinquent tax prepayment and penalties from the date of delinquency at the rate of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof, for each month the prepayment is delinquent, until paid. 
	(c)	Hotel and Parking Taxes. An operator subject to the Hotel Tax (Article 7) or the Parking Tax (Article 9) shall make monthly remittances in the amount of the actual tax owed. 
	(d)	Forms and Adjustments. Tax prepayments required under this Section shall be accompanied by a tax prepayment form prepared by the Tax Collector, but failure of the Tax Collector to furnish the taxpayer with a tax prepayment form shall not relieve the taxpayer from any tax prepayment obligation. The Tax Collector may, in writing, adjust the amount of a tax prepayment if the taxpayer can establish in writing by clear and convincing evidence that the first installment of semi-annual tax prepayments, or first, second or third monthly installment of a quarterly tax prepayment, will amount to more than one-half or one-quarter, respectively, of the person's total tax liability for the tax year in which the installment is due.

	(a)	For good cause, the Tax Collector, in his or her discretion, may extend, for a period not to exceed 60 days, the time for filing any return pursuant to this Article or regulations prescribed by the Tax Collector. For prepayments of taxes or for taxes required to be deposited monthly, the Tax Collector may only extend the time for filing a return for a period not to exceed 30 days. As a condition of such extension, the person seeking the extension shall make a payment of not less than 90 percent of such person's estimated liability for such period. For purposes of determining the amount of the conditional payment, the Tax Collector may independently establish the taxpayer's estimated tax liability. 
	(b)	Failure to make the required estimated prepayment will result in the taxpayer being subject to penalties and interest under Section 6.17-1. 
	(c)	Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section, the Tax Collector may extend any time for filing any return or payment of tax or excuse penalties for any late filing or late payment by a period not to exceed 60 days if billing or other administrative duties of the Tax Collector cannot be performed in a timely manner.

If a credit or exemption is invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, the taxpayer must pay any additional amount that the taxpayer would have owed but for such invalid credit or exemption. Amounts owed as a result of the invalidation of a credit or exemption that are paid within 3 years after the decision of the court becomes final shall not be subject to interest or penalties.

	(a)	Filing by Mail. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, taxpayers may file any return or other document with or make any payment to, including a prepayment to, the Tax Collector by United States mail. 
	(b)	Date of Postmark. The date of postmark shall be deemed the date of filing for any return or other document, or any payment, delivered to the Tax Collector by United States mail if: 
		(1)	The postmark is made by the United States Postal Service;
		(2)	The postmark date falls within the prescribed period, or on or before the prescribed date, including any extension, for filing the return or other document, or for making the payment;

The Tax Collector may provide by regulation for application of this rule to postmarks not made by the United States Postal Service. 
	(c)	Registered and Certified Mailing. The registration of any return or other document, or payment, delivered to the Tax Collector by registered mail shall be prima facie evidence that the return or other document, or payment, was filed with the Tax Collector, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The Tax Collector may provide by regulation for the application of this subsection to returns or other documents, or payments, delivered to the Tax Collector by certified mail. 
	(d)	Exceptions. This Section shall not apply to: 
		(1)	The filing of a document in, or the making of a payment to, any court;
		(2)	Currency or other medium of payment unless actually received and accounted for; or

			(A)	Is available to the general public;
			(B)	Is at least as timely and reliable on a regular basis as the United States mail;
			(C)	Records electronically to its database, kept in the regular course of its business, or marks on the cover in which any item referred to in this Section is to be delivered or filed, the date on which such item was given to such trade or business for delivery; and

		(2)	The Tax Collector may provide a rule similar to the rule of Subsection (1) with respect to any service provided by a designated delivery service which is substantially equivalent to the United States registered or certified mail.

SEC. 6.9-7.  PARTIAL PAYMENTS.
	(a)	Where a taxpayer owes payments for prior years, the Tax Collector may accept partial payments. The difference between the amount paid by the taxpayer and the total amount due shall be treated as a delinquent tax and shall be subject to penalties and interest on the unpaid balance pursuant to Section 6.17-1. 
	(b)	Unless the taxpayer specifies otherwise, the partial payments shall be applied to the oldest year's deficiency, first to administrative collection costs, interest, penalties and other costs and charges for that year, and the balance, if any, shall be applied to the taxes due for that year. Any remaining portion of the payment shall then be applied to the next oldest year's deficiency in the same manner and order. 
	(c)	The taxpayer may specify that the partial payment be applied to a tax year other than the oldest, but the order of payment between administrative collection costs, interest, penalties, other costs and charges, and taxes due shall remain the same.

SEC. 6.10-1.  COLLECTION OF TAX; SECURITY.
	The Tax Collector, whenever he or she deems it necessary to ensure compliance with the Business and Tax Regulations Code, may require any person subject thereto to deposit with the Tax Collector such security as the Tax Collector may determine. The amount of the security shall be fixed by the Tax Collector, but shall not be greater than twice the person's estimated average liability for the period for which said person files returns, determined in such manner as the Tax Collector deems proper. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the Tax Collector subject to the limitations herein provided. The Tax Collector may sell the security at public auction if it becomes necessary to do so in order to recover any tax or any amount required to be collected and remitted to the City, including any interest or penalty due. Notice of the sale shall be served upon the person who deposited the security and upon the taxpayer, if different, personally or by mail; if by mail, service shall be made in the manner prescribed for service of a notice of a deficiency determination as set out in Section 6.11-2 herein, and shall be addressed to the person at said person's address as it appears in the records of the Tax Collector. Upon any sale, any surplus above the amounts due shall be returned to the person who deposited the security.

After receiving such notice, the persons so notified shall, within 5 days of the receipt of the notice, advise the Tax Collector by sworn writing of all such credits, personal property, or debts. Further, the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession or under their control at the time they receive the notice until the Tax Collector consents to a transfer or disposition or until 30 days elapse after the person has advised the Tax Collector in a sworn writing of all such credits, personal property, or debts. Unless otherwise required by law, if persons so notified transfer such assets in violation of the provisions of this Section, they shall become indebted to the Tax Collector for the value of the property transferred, or the amount owed to the City by the delinquent, whichever is less.

SEC. 6.10-3.  COLLECTION OF TAX; LEGAL ACTIONS.
	(a)	(1)	The Tax Collector may bring an action in the courts of this State, or any other state, or of the District of Columbia, or of the United States and its territories or possessions, or any other forum where permitted by law to recover in the name of the City any amount of taxes due and payable under the Business and Tax Regulations Code and remaining unpaid, together with penalties, interest, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees. 
		(2)	In any action filed pursuant to this subdivision, the Complaint shall attach a certificate executed by the Tax Collector or his representative that contains the following information: 
			(A)	the name of the operator, taxpayer or other person determined to be liable for the tax; 
			(B)	the description of the operator's, taxpayer's or other person's business against which the tax has been assessed; 
			(C)	the location and/or address of the business; 
			(D)	the amount of the tax, penalty and interest remaining unpaid as of the last day of the month prior to the month in which the Complaint is filed; and 
			(E)	the fact that the City has complied with all provisions of the Business and Tax Regulations Code in the computation and the levy of the tax, penalty or interest. 
		(3)	In prosecuting such actions, the Tax Collector shall be entitled to all of the provisional remedies provided by law. Any such action shall be commenced within 3 years from the date any amount of taxes became due and payable, or from the date the return is required to be filed or actually filed, whichever period expires later; except in the case of any deficiency determination pursuant to Sections 6.11-1 et seq., 6.12-1 et seq., or 6.13-1 et seq., in which case any such action shall be commenced within 3 years after such determination became final. However, there shall be no limitation on the time in which such actions may be commenced in cases of fraud, intent to evade the Business and Tax Regulations Code, or failure to file a return. 
	(b)	When the amount of any tax, penalty or interest which has become due and payable remains unpaid for 15 days, the Tax Collector may record a tax lien with the Assessor-Recorder, thereby creating a tax lien on all of the assessee's property and rights to property, including realty, personalty, or intangibles. The Tax Collector may record or file such tax lien in the office of the Recorder of any California county, with the California Secretary of State, and with any other California public entity that is otherwise authorized by law to record liens. The Tax Collector may record or file such tax liens in any other office of any other jurisdiction as permitted by law. The tax lien shall identify the Tax Collector as the lienor, and the amount of the lien. Simultaneously with the recording, a copy of the tax lien shall be mailed to or personally served upon the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable for the tax at said person's last known address based upon the information, contained in the Tax Collector records. The tax lien after recordation has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and continues for 10 years from the date of recording, unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. This remedy and any other remedies for collection of any taxes, together with all administrative collection costs, interest, penalties and other costs and charges, including reasonable attorneys' fees, are cumulative and may be pursued alternatively and consecutively as the Tax Collector determines.

SEC. 6.11-1.  DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS; RECOMPUTATION; INTEREST.
	(a)	If the Tax Collector determines that a taxpayer has failed to pay or has underpaid a tax, that an operator has failed to collect and remit all of a third-party tax, or that a person other than the taxpayer is jointly and severally liable for any unpaid or underpaid tax, including third-party taxes, the Tax Collector may compute and determine any tax deficiency upon the basis of the return or returns or upon the basis of any other information with the Tax Collector's possession or that may come into the Tax Collector's possession. One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or for more than one period. 
	(b)	The amount of the determination, inclusive of penalties, shall bear interest at the rate of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the 15th day after the close of the month or the quarterly period for third-party taxes, or from the last day of February following the close of the annual period, for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned until the date of payment, or, in the case of stadium operator admission taxes, from the due dates of said tax as set forth in Article 11, Section 804. 
	(c)	In making a determination, the Tax Collector may offset overpayments for a period or periods together with interest on the overpayments, against underpayments for another period or periods, against penalties, and against the interest on the underpayments. The interest on underpayments and overpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in Section 6.17-1 for underpayments and in Section 6.15-2 for overpayments.

SEC. 6.11-2.  DEFICIENCY DETERMINATIONS; REVOCATION AND SUSPENSION DETERMINATIONS; NOTICE AND SERVICE.
	(a)	Upon making a determination pursuant to Section 6.11-1, or upon making a determination pursuant to Section 6.6-1 that a certificate shall not be issued or to suspend or revoke a registration, the Tax Collector shall give to the taxpayer or other person affected written notice of the Tax Collector's determination. Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade the Business and Tax Regulations Code or rules and regulations issued or promulgated by the Tax Collector, or failure to file a return, in which case there is no statute of limitations, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be served within 3 years after the date that a return was due for a tax for the reporting period or 3 years after the return was actually filed for that reporting period, whichever is later. This limitations period shall apply only to tax periods commencing after December 31, 2007. The notice requirements specified in Board of Supervisors Ordinance No. 26-04 shall continue to apply to obligations arising in prior tax periods. The Taxpayer may agree in writing to extend the period for service of a notice of a deficiency determination otherwise provided in this paragraph. 
	(b)	The notice of any determination under this Section may be served upon the taxpayer or other affected person personally or by mail; if by mail, service shall be

		(2)	to an address that the Tax Collector concludes in his discretion is the last known address of the person(s).

SEC. 6.11-3.  DETERMINATION IF NO RETURN MADE; ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY, PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
	(a)	If any taxpayer or person responsible for paying a tax or remitting a third-party tax fails to make a timely return or estimated tax prepayment, the Tax Collector may make a determination based upon an estimate of the amount of the total tax liability of the taxpayer. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the person failed to timely make a return, failed to timely make a prepayment or failed to timely remit a tax, and may be based upon any information which is in the Tax Collector's possession or may come into his or her possession. Upon the basis of this estimate, the Tax Collector shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the City, adding to the sum thus computed a penalty equal to 20 percent thereof. One or more determinations may be made for one or more than one period. Any such determination shall be prima facie evidence of the person's liability in any subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding. 
	(b)	In making a determination, the Tax Collector may offset overpayments for a period or periods, together with interest on the overpayments, against underpayments for another period or periods, against penalties, and against the interest on the underpayments. The interest on underpayments and overpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in Sections 6.17-1 and 6.15-2, respectively. The amount of the determinations, including penalties, shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the date of delinquency until the date of payment.

SEC. 6.12-1.  JEOPARDY DETERMINATIONS; DUTY OF TAX COLLECTOR.
	If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any tax or any amount of any third party tax required to be collected and paid to the City or of any determination will be jeopardized, in whole or in part, by delay, the Tax Collector shall serve notice upon the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable therefor of his or her determination of jeopardy and of the tax or amount of third party tax required to be paid to the City, and demanding immediate payment thereof, together with any interest and penalty determined to be due. The Tax Collector may consider all facts and circumstances relevant to determining whether the collection of any tax will be jeopardized by delay, including but not limited to indications that the taxpayer intends or is taking action to discontinue business activities in the City, dissipate or otherwise remove assets from the City, or sell, exchange, assign or otherwise dispose of personal or business income or property. The Tax Collector also may consider whether the taxpayer is insolvent or likely to become insolvent after the taxes at issue are assessed or collected; whether the taxpayer is or has been uncooperative or unresponsive in connection with any investigation, examination, audit, deficiency determination, assessment or collection action or procedure undertaken by the Tax Collector; what taxable years are at issue; how many taxable years are at issue; and whether the taxes at issue are third-party taxes.

SEC. 6.12-2.  JEOPARDY DETERMINATIONS; WHEN DUE AND PAYABLE; STAY OF COLLECTION; PETITION FOR REDETERMINATION; TIME OF HEARING.
	(a)	A jeopardy determination of tax, interest or penalty is immediately due and payable upon the service of the notice of jeopardy determination on the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable therefor. A lien for the amount due in the notice of jeopardy determination may be recorded immediately notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.10-1 et seq., summary judgment pursuant to Section 6.18-1 et seq. may be sought at once, and judicial proceedings for collection may be commenced at once. Prior to service of such notice, the Tax Collector may, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.10-1 et seq., record a lien in the amount due as set forth in the notice of jeopardy determination. Immediately upon service of such notice, the Tax Collector may, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.10-1 et seq., seek summary judgment pursuant to Section 6.18 et seq., and may commence a collection action in any court having jurisdiction over the matter. 
	(b)	The taxpayer may stay the enforcement of a jeopardy assessment by filing with the Tax Collector: (1) a bond in an amount equal to the amount of the assessment (together with interest thereon to the date of payment) payable on the Tax Collector's certification of the amount of the assessment after the Tax Collector makes a final determination of the taxpayer's petition, or (2) other security of a value as the Tax Collector deems necessary, but not exceeding double the amount of the assessment (together with interest thereon to the date of payment) together with a security agreement that authorizes the Tax Collector to use or dispose of the security to satisfy the amount of the assessment after the Tax Collector makes a final determination of the taxpayer's petition. The taxpayer must also agree to pay the assessment; upon notice and demand by the Tax Collector, after the Tax Collector makes a final determination of the petition. If the penal amount of the bond is less than the assessment, the Tax Collector may collect the part of the assessment that exceeds that penal amount. If the value of other security is less than twice the assessment, the Tax Collector may collect the assessment until the unpaid balance is reduced to twice the value of the security. Any stay pursuant to this subsection shall be effective only against the person on whose behalf the bond or other security is provided. 
	(c)	Upon filing of the bond or other security, the collection of so much of the jeopardy determination amount as is covered by the bond or other security shall be stayed pending the exercise by the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable for the tax of his or her appeal rights. The person on whose behalf the bond or other security is submitted, shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond or other security, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond or other security is paid, then the bond or other security shall, at the request of said person, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of the jeopardy determination is abated, the bond or other security shall be proportionately reduced, at the request of the person on whose behalf the bond or other security was provided. 
	(d)	Where collection of the whole or any amount of a jeopardy determination has been stayed under this Section, the period of limitation on any action to collect from the person on whose behalf the bond or other security has been provided shall be tolled during the period of such stay.

(Added by Ord. 18-98, App. 1/16/98)
SEC. 6.12-4.  JEOPARDY DETERMINATIONS; EFFECT OF NONPAYMENT.
	If the amount specified in the jeopardy determination is not paid within 15 days after service of notice thereof upon the person against whom the determination is made, and no petition for redetermination is filed within the 15 days, the delinquency penalty provided in Section 6.17-1 shall attach to the tax or the amount of the tax required to be collected. 
(Added by Ord. 18-98, App. 1/16/98)
SEC. 6.12-5.  JEOPARDY DETERMINATIONS; PETITION FOR REDETERMINATION.
	(a)	Any person against whom a jeopardy determination is made may petition for the redetermination thereof pursuant to Section 6.13-1 et seq. of this Article. The taxpayer shall, however, file the petition for redetermination with the Tax Collector within 15 days after the service of notice of determination. If a petition for redetermination of a jeopardy determination is not filed within the foregoing 15-day period, the determination becomes final at the expiration of that period. 
	(b)	The filing of a petition for redetermination of a jeopardy determination shall not operate to stay collection. Collection may be stayed only as provided in Section 6.12-2 above. 
	(c)	If a timely petition for redetermination of a jeopardy determination is filed, the Tax Collector shall review the matters raised in the petition including, if requested, whether the issuance of the jeopardy determination was warranted under the circumstances. In making this determination, the Tax Collector shall grant the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable for the tax or such taxpayer or person's authorized representative an oral hearing if requested in the petition. 
	(d)	If, in the review process, the Tax Collector determines that the determination of jeopardy was improper or unwarranted, any collection action taken shall be withdrawn, pending the ultimate administrative determination of the amount of the deficiency due from the taxpayer or other person claimed to be liable for the tax claimed to be due in the jeopardy determination notice. Neither the validity of the determination of tax, nor the burden of proof, shall be affected by the Tax Collector's determination that the determination of jeopardy was improper or unwarranted. 
	(e)	The taxpayer or other person determined to be liable for the tax has the right to an oral hearing and determination by the Tax Collector upon the matters raised in the petition within 45 days from the date of the filing of the petition for redetermination, as scheduled by the Tax Collector, unless the taxpayer waives said time period. The 45-day period shall be tolled between the date the Tax Collector serves a written notification under Section 6.13-1(b) that the Tax Collector requires additional information or records to evaluate and decide the petition, and the date the Tax Collector receives that information and those records.

SEC. 6.13-1.  REDETERMINATIONS; PETITION; TIME FOR FILING; INCOMPLETE PETITIONS.
	(a)	Any person against whom a determination is made under the Business and Tax Regulations Code may petition the Tax Collector for a redetermination within 30 days after service of the notice thereof, except for a petition for redetermination of a jeopardy determination, which the person may file within 15 days after service of the notice as provided in Section 6.12-5. If a petition for redetermination is not filed within the applicable period, the determination becomes final at the expiration of the period. The final determination may be enforced or collected by any method authorized by law, including but not limited to lien, levy, and judicial enforcement, including provisional remedies and injunctive relief. 
	(b)	(1)	Every petition for redetermination shall be verified by the person against whom the Tax Collector made the determination, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the petition is founded, with specificity sufficient to enable the Tax Collector to understand and evaluate the petition, and verifying the information and authenticating the records upon which the petitioner relies in support of the petition. Any ground for redetermination that is not specified in the petition for redetermination shall be deemed waived by the petitioner in any later judicial proceeding. 
		(2)	If the Tax Collector determines that the petition fails to state specific grounds for redetermination, lacks sufficient specificity to understand and evaluate the petition, or is not accompanied by information and records in support of the petition the Tax Collector reasonably deems necessary to evaluate and decide the petition, the Tax Collector in his or her discretion may either deny the petition as incomplete or may require the petitioner in writing to supplement the petition with additional information or records the Tax Collector deems reasonably necessary to decide the petition. The petitioner shall submit such information and records in support of the petition to the Tax Collector within 30 days of service of the Tax Collector's written request, which shall be served in the manner prescribed in Section 6.11-2. If mailed, service of the notice is complete at the time of deposit with the United States Postal Service. Failure of the petitioner to provide all of the information and records set forth in the written request within the 30-day period shall be sufficient ground for the Tax Collector to deny the petition, and the petitioner shall be subject to the penalties and sanctions provided in Section 6.17-3.

SEC. 6.13-2.  REDETERMINATIONS; HEARING AND NOTICE.
	If a petition for redetermination is timely filed, the Tax Collector shall reconsider the determination. If requested in the petition, the Tax Collector shall grant the person or the person's authorized representative an oral hearing, and shall give such person or representative not less than 15 days notice of the time and place of the hearing.

SEC. 6.13-3.  REDETERMINATIONS; ALTERATION OF DETERMINATION.
	The Tax Collector may decrease or increase the amount of the determination, including the amount of the tax, penalties or interest, before it becomes final. The amount may be increased only if a claim for the increase is asserted by the Tax Collector, and the Tax Collector provides written notice thereof to the person against whom the Tax Collector issued the determination. If the Tax Collector increases the amount before the hearing described in Section 6.13-2, such written notice shall be served at least 15 days before the hearing and the person receiving such notice shall file a supplemental petition for redetermination addressing the increased deficiency amount at least 5 days before the hearing date. The Tax Collector may reschedule the hearing for purposes of allowing the requisite notice of increase. If the Tax Collector increases the amount after the hearing described in Section 6.13-2, the Tax Collector shall serve notice of such increase before issuing a final decision. Within 15 days of service of such notice, the person against whom a claim for increase is asserted by the Tax Collector may serve a supplemental petition for redetermination contesting the increased deficiency amount. The Tax Collector shall hold an additional oral hearing on the increased amount upon the request of the petitioner. A supplemental petition for redetermination filed pursuant to this Section shall state any additional specific grounds for redetermination applicable to the increased deficiency amount. Any specific ground for redetermination that is not specified in either the initial petition for redetermination or the supplemental petition for redetermination shall be deemed waived by the petitioner in any later judicial proceeding. Nothing in this Section shall preclude a new audit or determination by the Tax Collector of a new or supplemental deficiency.

SEC. 6.15-1.  REFUNDS.
	(a)	Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c) below, the Controller shall refund or cause to be refunded the amount of any tax, interest or penalty that has been overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, provided the person that paid such amount files with the Controller, within the later of 1 year of payment of such amount or when the return accompanying such payment was due, a verified claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury: (1) the specific amount claimed to have been overpaid or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, (2) the tax periods at issue, and (3) the grounds upon which the claim is founded, with specificity sufficient to enable the Tax Collector and other responsible City officials to understand and evaluate the claim. The Controller shall enter the claim in the claim register, and shall forthwith forward it to the City Attorney. If the City Attorney determines the claim is insufficient, the City Attorney shall give the claimant written notice of how the claim is insufficient, stating with particularity the defects or omissions therein. The City Attorney shall send the claimant that notice within 20 days after the claimant presents the claim. The City Attorney may reject any and all claims the Controller forwards to the City Attorney, and shall notify the claimant of such rejection. Allowance or compromise and settlement of claims under this Section in excess of $25,000 shall require the written approval of the City Attorney and approval of the Board of Supervisors by resolution. The City Attorney may allow or compromise and settle such claims if the amount is $25,000 or less. No claim may be paid until the Controller certifies that monies are available from the proper funds or appropriations to pay the claim as allowed or as compromised and settled. For purposes of this Section, a claim shall be deemed to accrue on the later of the date the return was due or the tax was paid. 
	(b)	The claim shall be on a form furnished by the Controller. A claim may be returned to the person if it was not presented using the form. A refund claim may be made only by the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable for the tax or said person's guardian or conservator. No other agent, including the taxpayer's attorney, may sign a refund claim. Class claims for refunds shall not be permitted. The customer who pays a third-party tax to an operator is the proper party to seek the refund of a disputed third-party tax. No operator or other person responsible for collecting or remitting a disputed third-party tax may obtain a tax refund unless that operator or other person has paid the tax to the Tax Collector pursuant to a deficiency determination or a jeopardy determination in which case the operator or other person who paid the tax, and not the individual customer, may seek a refund. If the claim is approved as set forth in subsection (a) above, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amount due and payable, from the person from whom it was collected or by whom paid and the balance may be refunded to such person, his administrator or executors. 
	(c)	The City Attorney, in his or her discretion and upon good cause shown, prior to the expiration of the 1-year limitations period, may waive the requirement set forth in subdivision (a) above that a taxpayer file a written verified claim for a refund in any case in which the Tax Collector and City Attorney determine on the basis of other evidence that 
		(1)	an amount of tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, and 
		(2)	all other conditions precedent to the payment of a refund to the taxpayer have been satisfied. 
	(d)	The City Attorney shall allow, reject or otherwise act upon a claim for refund in a manner specified in Government Code Section 912.6 within 45 days after it is presented to the Controller. If the claim is amended, the City Attorney shall act on the amended claim within 45 days after the amended claim is presented. The claimant may agree in writing to extend the period within which the City Attorney must act on the claim for refund prior to expiration of the original 45-day period. The claimant may deem the claim for refund denied and seek judicial relief if the City Attorney does not act upon the claim within the 45-day period, or such extended period to which the claimant has agreed. 
	(e)	The Tax Collector may authorize the Controller to refund tax payments, without a refund claim having been filed, without the need for a refund claim, and without review by the City Attorney, if the Tax Collector determines: 
		(1)	the tax was paid more than once; or
		(2)	the amount paid exceeds the amount due as a result of an arithmetic or clerical error. The Tax Collector may authorize such a refund no later than 1 year after payment of the tax.

SEC. 6.15-2.  REFUNDS; INTEREST.
	(a)	Any amounts refunded shall bear interest at the rate of 2/3 of 1 percent per month or fraction thereof; or the average rate of interest computed over the preceding 6-month period obtained, by the San Francisco Treasurer on deposits of public funds at the time refund is made, whichever rate is lower, and shall be computed from the date of payment to the date of refund. 
	(b)	If the Controller offsets overpayments for a period or periods against underpayments for another period or periods, against penalties or against interest on the underpayments, the taxpayer will be credited with interest on the amount so applied at the rate of interest set forth above, computed from the date of payment. 
	(c)	If a taxpayer chooses to apply all or part of a refund against a San Francisco tax liability for a future period, the taxpayer will not be credited with interest on the amount so applied. 
(Added by Ord. 18-98, App. 1/16/98; amended by Ord. 26-04, File No. 031990, App. 2/19/2004; Ord. 291-10, File No. 101099, App. 11/18/2010) 
SEC. 6.15-3.  REFUNDS; NOTICE OF DENIAL.
	If the claim for refund is denied, the City Attorney shall serve or cause to be served notice of such denial upon the taxpayer personally or by mail. The notice of denial of such claim shall be in a form substantially similar to the form for notice of rejection of claims set forth in Government Code Section 913. If the City Attorney does not serve such a notice of denial of claim, then the statute of limitations for filing a suit for refund shall be as set forth in Section 6.15-4.

SEC. 6.15-4.  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES; PRESENTATION OF CLAIM FOR REFUND AS PREREQUISITE TO SUIT; PAYMENT OF DISPUTED AMOUNT AND PETITION FOR REFUND; LIMITATIONS.
	(a)	Persons claiming they are aggrieved under the Business and Tax Regulations Code must prior to seeking judicial relief: 
		(1) 	pay the amount of the disputed tax, penalty and interest; 
		(2)	if the disputed tax was paid pursuant to the Tax Collector's jeopardy determination or deficiency determination, file a petition for redetermination, pursuant to Section 6.12-5 or Section 6.13-1; and
		(3) 	present a claim for refund to the Controller and allow action to be taken on such claim, pursuant to Section 6.15-1. 
	(b)	Any suit for tax refund shall be commenced no later than 6 months from the date the notice of denial of the claim for refund was personally delivered or deposited in the mail, or within 2 years of accrual of the cause of action if notice of denial of the claim for refund is not served on the person as set forth in Section 6.15-3. Persons claiming they are aggrieved under the Business and Tax Regulations Code may not seek any type of judicial relief other than a refund action. Notwithstanding any other section of this Code, no claim or defense that, for any reason, a tax is not due or cannot be applied under this Code may be raised in any judicial proceeding except as specified in the preceding sentence.

The Tax Collector shall hold a public hearing and allow public comment on any proposed rule or regulation prior to adoption thereof. The Tax Collector shall provide not less than 10 days' notice of such public hearing. A copy of such rules and regulations shall be on file and available for public examination in the Tax Collector's Office. Failure or refusal to comply with any rules and regulations promulgated by the Tax Collector shall be deemed a violation of the Business and Tax Regulations Code.

SEC. 6.17-1.  PENALTIES AND INTEREST FOR FAILURE TO PAY.
	(a)	Any person who fails to pay any tax to the City, or any operator or other person who fails to collect and remit any third-party taxes shall pay a penalty of 5 percent of the tax, if the failure is for not more than 1 month after the tax became delinquent, plus an additional 5 percent for each following month or fraction of a month during which such failure continues, up to 20 percent in the aggregate, until the date of payment. Any taxes remaining unpaid for a period of 90 days after notification that the tax is delinquent shall be subject to an additional penalty of 20 percent of the tax or amount of the tax.

SEC. 6.19-4.  VIOLATIONS.
	(a)	Separate and Continuing Violations; Penalties Paid Do Not Cure Violations. Each and every day that a violation exists constitutes a separate and distinct offense. Each section violated constitutes a separate violation for any day at issue. If the person or persons responsible for a violation fail to correct the violation, subsequent administrative citations may be issued for the same violation(s). Payment of the penalty shall not excuse the failure to correct the violation nor shall it bar any further enforcement action by the City. If penalties and costs are the subject of administrative appeal or judicial review, then the accrual of such penalties and costs shall be stayed until the determination of such appeal or review is final. 
	(b)	Payments to City; Due Date; Late Payment Penalty. All penalties assessed shall be payable to the City and County. Administrative penalties and costs assessed by means of an administrative citation shall be due within 30 days from the date of the citation. The failure of any person to pay an administrative penalty and costs within that time shall result in the assessment of an additional late fee. The amount of the late fee shall be 10 percent of the total amount of the administrative penalty assessed for each month the penalty and any already accrued late payment penalty remains unpaid. 
	(c)	Collection of Penalties; Special Assessments. The failure of any person to pay a penalty assessed by administrative citation within the time specified on the citation constitutes a debt to the City. The City may file a civil action, create and impose liens as set forth below, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such money. 
	(d)	Liens. The City may create and impose liens against any property owned or operated by a person who fails to pay a penalty assessed by administrative citation. The procedures provided for in Section 6.10-3 shall govern the imposition and collection of such liens.

	(b)	Unless the Operator can provide an explanation or other sufficient proof that the Enforcing Agency in its sole discretion deems to be credible to establish the validity of a claim for a Lost Ticket or an otherwise Unaccounted Ticket (as those terms are defined in Section 2201 of Article 22 of this Code), every Lost Ticket and Unaccounted Ticket shall be considered as a full value Parking Ticket for which the Operator is liable for transmitting to the City the full value of the Parking Tax and surcharge required under this Code applicable to the highest maximum daily rate charged for any parking space without discount, except that an Operator shall be allowed an Unaccounted Ticket Ratio of 1.5 percent for each Parking Station that it operates (as that term is defined and used in Article 22 of this Code) in a reporting period, for which the Operator may not be liable for failure to remit the Parking Tax. 
	(c)	The Operator shall have the burden of explaining and establishing the validity of Lost Tickets and Cancelled Transactions, as those terms are defined in Article 22 of this Code. The Enforcing Agency may consider a verifiable statement signed by the Occupant claiming a Lost Ticket that includes the Occupant's name, address, telephone number, the Occupant's Motor Vehicle license plate number, the time of entry and the time of exit as sufficient proof of a valid Lost Ticket transaction. An Operator shall maintain a log of all Lost Tickets and Cancelled Transactions. The Enforcing Agency may consider in its sole and absolute discretion an Operator's log of Cancelled Transactions or Lost Ticket transactions that includes the cashier or attendant's name and/or Log File identification number who processed the Transaction, the date and time of the Transaction, and a credible reason for processing the transaction as a Lost Ticket transaction. 
	(d)	The Tax Collector shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of the tax and such methods and schedules shall provide that the fractional part of 1 cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to ½ of 1 cent or more, in which case the amount (determined without regard to the fractional part of 1 cent) shall be increased by 1 cent.

	(b)	Operator's RCE Certification. Concurrent with remittance of Parking Taxes to the City pursuant to Business and Tax Regulations Code Section 6.7-1, an Operator shall certify in writing under penalty of perjury that it has utilized RCE that complies with the applicable provisions of Article 22 of this Code during the period for which the Operator remits the Parking Taxes. If the Operator remits Parking Taxes to the City on a monthly basis, then the Operator shall certify that during the immediately preceding month it utilized RCE that complies with all applicable provisions of this Article.

	(c)	Operator's RCE Records Review Certification. Concurrent with remittance of Parking Taxes to the City pursuant to Business and Tax Regulations Code Section 6.7-1, an Operator shall also certify in writing under penalty of perjury that it has reviewed the RCE Records, as defined at Section 2201(b) of this Code, as to amounts of gross revenue, Rent received, Parking Tax collected and remitted, discounts provided, and Unaccounted Ticket Ratio for each Parking Station that it operated in the period reported.

The Unaccounted Ticket Ratio shall be calculated as follows. The number of Unaccounted Tickets for a reporting period is calculated separately for each Parking Station operated by the Operator as the sum of Inventory at the start of the reporting period and the Issued Tickets for that period, less the Voided Tickets for that period, less the Collected Tickets for that period. The Unaccounted Ticket Ratio is calculated as the number of Unaccounted Tickets for a particular Parking Station for that period divided by the number of Issued Tickets for that period, with the resulting quotient multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage of Issued Tickets.

SEC. 608.  SPECIAL SCHOOL PARKING EVENT PERMITS.
	(a)	Findings. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco hereby finds and determines that:
		(1)	San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code Articles 6, 9 and 22 require that Occupants of Parking Stations pay a 25 percent tax that is collected and remitted to the City by parking Operators. Operators must register with the City and meet other parking Operator requirements.
		(2)	San Francisco Police Code Section 1215 requires that Commercial Parking Operators obtain an annual permit.
		(3)	Special parking events on San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) property, operated by the volunteers of non-profit organizations, such as Parent Teacher Associations and Parent Teacher Organizations constitute a beneficial activity to supplement SFUSD school revenues that have been drastically reduced by State budget cuts.
		(4)	Requiring parent volunteers to register as parking Operators is a burden on the volunteer organizers of these events who are staging them for the sole benefit of the SFUSD schools.
		(5)	Therefore, in order for volunteer organizers to be able to reap the full benefit of their efforts and help the schools to better meet the needs of their students, the San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code and Police Code are amended to provide for Special School Parking Event Permits.
	(b)	No tax shall be imposed hereunder on Rent for the occupancy of parking space in parking stations at special school parking events, provided that the following requirements are met:
		(1)	The parking activity is conducted on San Francisco Unified School District ("SFUSD") property.
		(2)	The parking activity is conducted by a volunteer led organization having a formally recognized exemption from income taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
		(3)	One hundred percent of the earnings from the parking activity are for the sole benefit of San Francisco public schools. No part of the organization's earnings from the parking activity may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
		(4)	The organization holds a Special School Parking Event Permit issued by the Tax Collector to conduct the parking activity, which must be publicly displayed during the operation of the parking activity.
		(5)	The gross revenue from the special school parking event does not exceed $10,000.
	(c)	The Tax Collector or designee may issue up to a maximum of 150 Special School Parking Event Permits annually on a first come, first served basis, to the President, Chief Administrative Officer, or the equivalent of the Second District PTA, for distribution to qualifying organizations, for the purpose of conducting special school parking events that meet the requirements of this Section. Each permit may be used to conduct only one special school parking event. Special School Parking Event Permits are not transferrable and shall be valid only during the calendar year in which they are issued. Any organization conducting a special school parking event must in advance of the event notify the Tax Collector of the date and location of the special school parking event and must have the permit available for inspection on-site during the event.
	(d)	The Tax Collector shall prescribe the form of the Special School Parking Event Permit application. The Tax Collector or his or her designee shall determine whether an organization meets the requirements of this Section and is eligible to receive a permit. The Tax Collector shall not charge any fee to apply for or obtain a Special School Parking Event Permit.
		(1)	The Second District PTA shall keep and preserve business records, and make them available to the Tax Collector or his or her designee as may be necessary to determine the organization's eligibility and use of the Special School Parking Event Permits, including all local, state and federal tax returns of any kind, for a period of 5 years from the date the permit is issued.
		(2)	The Second District PTA shall submit annual returns on a form prescribed by the Tax collector. Required data shall include the number of permits received from the Tax Collector, the number of special school parking events conducted and the date of each event, the rate charged for parking at each event, and the dollar value of gross revenues for each event.
		(3)	Upon the request of the Tax Collector or his or her designee, the Second District PTA shall produce such business records at the Tax Collector’s Office during normal business hours for inspection, examination, and copying. Refusal to allow full inspection, examination, or copying of such records shall subject the organization to revocation of any existing permits and disqualify it from eligibility for Special School Parking Event Permits in the future.
	(e)	An organization that collects Rent for occupancy of parking space for a special school parking event pursuant to this Section 608 shall also be exempt from the requirement to obtain a certificate of authority from the Tax Collector pursuant to Section 6.6-1(a) of Article 6, or to execute a parking tax bond pursuant to Section 6.6-1(g) of Article 6, provided that the Operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector that it meets all of the requirements in Section 608(a).
	(f)	An organization that collects Rent for occupancy of parking space for a special school parking event pursuant to this Section 608 shall be exempted from the Revenue Control Equipment requirements in Article 22 of this Code.
	(g)	For each year for which the Special School Parking Event Permits authorized under this Section 608 are available, the Tax Collector shall submit an annual report to the Board of Supervisors that sets forth aggregate information regarding the dollar value of the gross revenues taken in each year, the number of permits issued, and the parking tax revenue foregone. 
	(h)	Termination Date. The exemption granted in this Ordinance shall expire by operation of law on December 31, 2015, and the City Attorney shall cause it to be removed from future editions of the Business and Tax Regulations Code unless the Board of Supervisors or the voters extends the exemption prior to December 31, 2015. If the exemption in this Section expires under this subsection (h), the Tax Collector shall not issue any Special School Parking Event Permits after that expiration date.
	(i)	Severability. If any provision of this Ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the Ordinance and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

SEC. 609.  PARKING SPACE OCCUPANCY TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES.
	(a)	Findings.
		(1)	San Francisco's parking tax generates revenue for the City's general fund, which in turn funds the provision of many vital services for residents.
		(2)	Any person who rents parking space in a Parking Station, as defined in Article 9 of the Business and Tax Regulations Code, must collect parking tax from the individual parking the car and remit it to the City. Current City law treats large commercial operators of garages and small property owners the same for purposes of this tax.
		(3)	It is estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of small property owners rent at least one parking space to non-residents, but do not register with the City or collect and remit parking tax.
		(4)	Many small property owners are ignorant of the legal requirements.
		(5)	Some small property owners may wish to comply with the law, but fear substantial tax liabilities, including penalties and interest, and therefore, do not come forward.
		(6)	The City desires to maximize the collection of required taxes.
		(7)	Therefore, in order to encourage small property owners to come forward, to register with the City, and to start collecting parking tax, this Ordinance will forgive taxes owed for tax periods ending before April 1, 2011.
		(8)	The Board of Supervisors finds that by providing a period of amnesty and by simplifying the registration process, many small property owners will begin to comply with the law, resulting in an overall increase in tax revenue remitted to the City.
	(b)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the owner or manager of a residential building, that operates a Parking Station that is a part of the residential building and, is located on the same parcel, or within 50 feet of the property line of the building, shall be relieved of certain requirements for Parking Stations as enumerated below, provided the owner or manager meets all of the requirements of and registers under Subsection (c) below. The aforesaid building owner or manager:
		(1)	Shall not be required to obtain a certificate of authority from the Tax Collector pursuant to Article 6, Section 6.6-1(a) or to execute a bond pursuant to Section 6.6-1(h), or to comply with any requirement to obtain insurance to operate a Parking Station.
		(2)	Shall not be required to make monthly tax prepayments pursuant to Section 6.9-3(a)(1), provided that the gross revenues of the Parking Station from Rent collected from individuals that do not reside at the property do not exceed $4,000 in a quarterly reporting period or $15,000 annually. At any time that the gross revenues of the Parking Station from Rent exceed $4,000 during any quarterly reporting period, the building owner or manager must report and file monthly tax prepayments as required by Section 6.9-3(a)(1) beginning with the following month.
		(3)	Is registered under Subsection (c) below, and if eligible for parking tax simplification for a specific Parking Station, shall not be required to pay the Revenue Control Equipment Compliance Fee in Article 22, Section 2219.5 for that Parking Station.
		(4)	Shall not be required to hold a commercial parking permit under Section 1215(b) of the Police Code.
	(c)	In order to be eligible for the relief authorized under this Section, the building owner or manager must register for relief using a simple form prescribed by the Tax Collector for that purpose, and provide information required by the Tax Collector. The owner or manager shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector that the residential property and Parking Station rentals meet all of the following requirements:
		(1)	No more than 5 spaces in the Parking Station are rented to individuals who do not reside at the residential property.
		(2)	Spaces are rented to individuals who do not reside at the property on a monthly basis only.
		(3)	The building owner or manager complies with the Revenue Control Equipment requirements in Article 22, Section 2207.
		(4)	Total gross receipts from the rental of parking space to individuals who do not reside at the property does not exceed $4, 000 in any quarter or $15,000 annually.
	(d)	In addition, the owner or manager must:
		(1)	Maintain documents and records of all parking transactions in a manner acceptable to the Tax Collector. Such documents and records must objectively substantiate any relief claimed under this Section and be provided to the Tax Collector or designee upon request.
		(2)	Timely file with the Tax Collector annually a parking space occupancy tax return, regardless of the amount of tax liability shown on the return. All returns shall be filed by the due date set forth in Article 6 of the San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code. 
		(3)	Any owner or manager who makes a material misrepresentation in a registration or fails to amend a registration within 7 days of a material change or who fails to comply with a rule or regulation promulgated by the Tax Collector in a timely manner shall, in addition to any other liability that may be imposed under the provisions of this Article, be ineligible to claim relief under this Section.
	(e)	The Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector may adopt forms, rules and regulations regarding the relief provided under this Section. The Tax Collector shall verify whether the applicant is entitled to the Parking Tax Simplification under this Ordinance.
	(f)	Amnesty.
		(1)	The building owner or manager who registers for relief under this Section between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2013 and satisfies the eligibility requirements established in Subsections 609(b) and (c) of this Article shall be eligible for amnesty from all fees, penalties and interest for failure to report and remit parking space occupancy tax due and payable prior to June 30, 2013 and shall, in addition, be eligible for amnesty from all parking space occupancy taxes for the tax periods ending before April 1, 2011, with the following exceptions: 
			(A)	The Tax Collector may not waive any liability owed as a result of any jeopardy determination served on the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable pursuant to Article 6, Section 6.12-1 of this Code or any audit deficiency determination that has been reduced to a written notice of deficiency determination and served on the taxpayer or other person determined to be liable pursuant to Article 6, Section 6.11-2 of this Code prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
			(B)	The Tax Collector shall not waive, under the authority of this Article, liabilities that the City has sought in any civil tax collection litigation commenced by the Tax Collector prior to the commencement of the amnesty application period.
		(2)	The Tax Collector shall waive all taxes, fees, penalties and interest owed for delinquent remittance of parking space occupancy taxes owed under the provisions of Articles 6 and 9 of the Business and Tax Regulations Code, but forgiven under this Section 690(f)1, without need to make the findings required under Section 6.17-4.
		(3)	The Tax Collector shall waive all fees, penalties and interest owed for failure to collect and/or remit parking space occupancy taxes under Article 22 and Sections 6.17-1, 6.17-2, and 6.17-3 of this Code.
		(4)	No proceeding to suspend or revoke a business registration certificate pursuant to Section 6.6-1 of this Code shall be initiated based on an owner's or manager's failure to collect or remit parking space occupancy taxes for which the Tax Collector has granted amnesty.
		(5)	No administrative proceeding or civil or criminal action on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco shall be brought against an owner or manager for any tax period for which the Tax Collector grants amnesty based upon the nonreporting, under-reporting, failure to remit parking space occupancy tax or the nonpayment of or failure to remit any taxes owed under the provisions of Article 22 of this Code.
		(6)	If the Tax Collector determines that the person registering for relief under this Section is delinquent in any taxes, fees or penalties owed to the City and County of San Francisco other than the parking tax, that person shall be ineligible to claim the relief under this Subsection (f).

		(8)	Common carriers and telecommunications companies.

However, no credit may be allowed for any tax paid to another taxing jurisdiction to the extent that the telephone communications service may not legally be made the subject of taxation by the other taxing jurisdiction, nor shall the amount of credit exceed the tax owed to the City under this Section. 
	(f)	If a non-taxable service and a taxable service are billed together under a single charge, the entire charge shall be deemed taxable unless the telephone communications service supplier or taxpayer reasonably identifies actual charges for services not subject to the tax. The telephone communications service supplier or taxpayer seeking a reduction has the burden of proving the proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and non-taxable charges based upon books and records that are kept in the regular course of business and in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

SEC. 708.   COLLECTION OF TAX.
	(a)	Unless prohibited by the laws of the United States or the State of California, or exempted by the provisions of this Code every person using telephone communications services, electrical water gas or steam services in this City and County shall be required to pay the tax imposed in this Article and Article 10B to the service supplier along with the charges made for such services. This obligation is not satisfied until the tax has been paid to this City and County, except that a receipt indicating payment of the service charges from a service supplier maintaining a place of business in this City and County or from a supplier who is authorized by the Tax Collector to collect the tax shall be sufficient to relieve the service user from further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers. 
	(b)	Every service supplier maintaining a place of business in this City and County, and providing telephone communications services electrical, water gas or steam services to a service user, not exempted under this Code shall, at the time of collecting the charges made for such services from the service user, also collect the tax imposed by this Article and Article 10B from the service user and on demand shall give to the service user a receipt therefor. In all cases in which the tax is not collected by the service supplier, as aforesaid, the service supplier shall be liable to the Tax Collector of the City and County for the amount of the tax due on the amount of taxable service charges collected from the service user under the provisions of this Article and Article 10B, the same as though the tax were paid by the service user. In all cases of transactions upon credit or deferred payment, the payment of tax to the Tax Collector may be deferred in accordance therewith, and the service supplier shall be liable therefor at the time and to the extent that such credits are paid or deferred payments are made in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount thereof. 
		The Tax Collector shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of the tax and such methods and schedules shall eliminate fractions of one cent. 
	(c)	The taxes imposed by this Article and Article 10B shall be collected, insofar as practicable, at the same time as and along with the collection of charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. If the amount paid by a service user is less than the full amount of the charges and tax which has accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charges and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. 
		The duty to collect shall arise separately for each period for which a service supplier bills a service user. 
	(d)	The Tax Collector may issue administrative rulings identifying telephone communications services that are subject to the taxes imposed by Section 703 of this Article and Article 10B. Such rulings shall be consistent with legal requirements and shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by California Government Code Section 53750(h)(2) and (3) or other law. To the extent that the Tax Collector determines that the taxes imposed under Section 703 or Article 10B shall not be collected in full for any period of time, such a determination falls within the Tax Collector's prosecutorial discretion to settle disputes. The Tax Collector's exercise of such forbearance under this Section does not constitute a change in taxing methodology for purposes of Government Code section 53750(h), and the City does not waive or abrogate its ability to impose the taxes imposed by Section 703 or Article 10B in full as a result of such determinations and may suspend such determinations and recommence enforcement of the taxes without additional voter approval. 
	(e)	A service supplier shall be obligated to collect and remit the tax imposed by Section 703 of this Article and Article 10B if it is "engaging in business within the City" as described in Article 6, Section 6.2-12.

The Tax Collector shall notify the service user that he has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by handing it to him personally or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the service supplier, or, should the service user have changed his address, to his last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Collector within 15 days from the date of the service of the notice upon him, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than $5.00. The penalty shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. This penalty shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other penalties provided in this Code.

SEC. 856.  REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE – APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE.
	(a)	Each person engaging in business within the City shall apply to the Tax Collector for a registration certificate, using the form prescribed by the Tax Collector.

		(1)	For the registration year commencing on or after July 1, 2014 and ending June 30, 2015, the fee for obtaining a registration certificate for a newly established business shall be determined pursuant to Section 855(c) of this Article using the applicant's estimated payroll expense under Article 12-A (Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance) for the tax year in which the person commences such business within the City. For registration years commencing on or after July 1, 2015, the fee for obtaining a registration certificate for a newly established business shall be determined pursuant to Section 855(e) of this Article using the applicant's estimated gross receipts under Article 12-A-1 (Gross Receipts Tax Ordinance) for the tax year in which the person commences such business within the City. The registration fee shall be prorated as follows: For persons commencing business between January 1st and March 31st, the registration fee shall be 50 percent of the annual fee; for persons commencing business between April 1st and June 30th, the registration fee shall be 25 percent of the annual fee; for persons commencing business between July 1st and September 30th, the registration fee shall be 100 percent of the annual fee; and for persons commencing business between October 1st and December 31st, the registration fee shall be 75 percent of the annual fee.

		(2)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, no person obtaining a registration certificate for a newly established business that qualifies for the minimum registration fee set forth in Section 855 of this Article shall be entitled to prorate the registration fee under this Section, but instead shall pay the minimum registration fee.

	(d)	Promptly after receiving a properly completed application and registration fee from any person, the Tax Collector shall determine whether the applicant has paid all outstanding: (1) gross receipts taxes; (2) payroll expense taxes; (3) costs and/or charges assessed pursuant to Article 5.1 of the Public Works Code, as amended from time to time, for failure to abate a nuisance regarding the cleanliness of an abutting public sidewalk or right-of-way; and (4) other taxes and license fees due to the City.

If the Tax Collector determines that all liabilities have been paid, the Tax Collector shall issue a registration certificate to the applicant for each place of business maintained by the applicant. 
	(e)	If a person submits a timely application under this Section and the Tax Collector determines that the applicant has satisfied all the requirements of this Article, including the payment of all outstanding liabilities owed to the City, then the Tax Collector shall issue a registration certificate to the applicant within 30 days after the Tax Collector makes such determination.
	(f)	Each registration certificate shall be non-assignable and nontransferable. The holder of the registration certificate shall surrender the certificate to the Tax Collector immediately upon the sale or transfer of the business for which the Tax Collector issued the registration certificate. The holder of the registration certificate shall also surrender the certificate to the Tax Collector when such holder ceases to conduct business at the location designated in the certificate.
	(g)	If the Tax Collector determines that any liabilities enumerated in subsection (d) of this Section remain unpaid as of the date an application is received, the Tax Collector shall give written notification of that fact to the applicant. The written notification shall set forth the amount owed, the liabilities enumerated in subsection (d) of this Section for which the amount(s) are owed, the dates the liabilities were incurred and any other information the Tax Collector deems necessary to apprise the applicant of what specific liabilities are owed to the City. The Tax Collector shall not issue a registration certificate unless and until the applicant has paid all amounts owing to the City, including, but not limited to, taxes, license fees, and costs or charges assessed for failure to abate a nuisance condition on a public right-of-way under Article 5.1 of the Public Works Code, as amended from time to time, for which the applicant is liable; provided, that if a good faith dispute exists regarding the amount of the outstanding liability or liabilities owed by the applicant to the City and the dispute is pending before a City agency or court of competent jurisdiction, then the Tax Collector shall not refuse to issue a registration certificate solely for non-payment of the amount in dispute. 
	(h)	Each registration certificate, and each duplicate thereof, shall set forth the name under which the person transacts or intends to transact business, the location of the registrant's place of business and such other information as the Tax Collector may require, and be prominently displayed therein. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the registration certificate shall be signed by the sole proprietor; in the case of a partnership, the registration certificate shall be signed by a general partner; in the case of a limited liability company, the registration certificate shall be signed by the managing member; and in the case of a corporation, the registration certificate shall be signed by the person authorized by the corporation to sign on its behalf. 
	(i)	Each person liable for payment of a registration fee pursuant to this Article shall pay only one annual registration fee. The Tax Collector shall issue a separate registration certificate for each location within the City where the person engages in business.
	(j)	The person may register up to 15 fictitious business names (sometimes abbreviated DBA, dba or d/b/a) without an additional charge. The Tax Collector shall charge a fee of $25, in addition to the registration fee, for each fictitious business name under which the business or operation is registered to conduct business in the City in addition to the first 15 fictitious business names registered.
	(k)	In addition to all other civil penalties provided for by law, the Tax Collector may charge any person who fails to register in a timely manner a fictitious business name or a location within the City where the person engages in business, an administrative penalty of $500 per fictitious business name or business location that the person fails to register.

	(a)	The term "Payroll Expense" means the compensation paid to, on behalf of, or for the benefit of an individual, including shareholders of a professional corporation or a Limited Liability Company ("LLC"), including salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, property issued or transferred in exchange for the performance of services (including but not limited to stock options), compensation for services to owners of pass-through entities, and any other form of compensation, who during any tax year, perform work or render services, in whole or in part in the City; and if more than one individual or shareholders of a professional corporation or members of an LLC, during any tax year performs work or renders services in whole or in part in the City, the term "Payroll Expense" means the total compensation paid including salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, property issued or transferred in exchange for the performance of services (including but not limited to stock options), in addition to any compensation for services to owners of pass-through entities, and any other form of compensation for services, to all such individuals and shareholders of a professional corporation or members of an LLC. 
	(b)	Any person that grants a service provider a right to acquire an ownership interest in such person in exchange for the performance of services shall include in its payroll expense for the tax year in which such right is exercised an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of such ownership interest on the date such right is exercised over (ii) the price paid for such interest. 
	(c)	Any individual compensated in his or her capacity as a real estate salesperson or mortgage processor shall be deemed an employee of the real estate broker or mortgage broker for or under whom such individual performs services, and any compensation received by such individual, including compensation by way of commissions, shall be included in the payroll expense of such broker. For purposes of this Section, "real estate broker" and "mortgage broker" refer to any individual licensed as such under the laws of the State of California who engages the services of salespersons or a salesperson, or of mortgage processors or a mortgage processor, to perform services in the business which such broker conducts under the authority of his or her license; a "salesperson" is an individual who is engaged by a real estate broker to perform services, which may be continuous in nature, as a real estate salesperson under an agreement with a real estate broker, regardless of whether the individual is licensed as a real estate broker under the law of the State of California, a "mortgage processor" is an individual who is engaged by a real estate broker or mortgage broker to perform services which may be continuous in nature, as a mortgage processor under an agreement with such real estate broker or mortgage broker, regardless of whether the mortgage processor is also licensed as a mortgage broker under the laws of the State of California.

SEC. 904.   APPORTIONMENT OF PAYROLL EXPENSE.
	Where payroll expense is incurred by reason of work performed or services rendered by an individual, wholly within the City, all of the payroll expense for such individual shall be attributable to the City and subject to tax hereunder. Where payroll expense is incurred by reason of work performed or services rendered by an individual partly within and partly without the City, the portion of such payroll expense attributable to the City (and subject to tax hereunder) shall be determined as follows: 
	(a)	Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of such payroll expense attributable to the City shall be the portion of such payroll expense which the total number of working hours employed within the City bears to the total number of working hours within and without the City. 
	(b)	If the amount of such payroll expense depends on the volume of business transacted by such individual, then the portion of such payroll expense attributable to the City shall be the portion of such payroll expense which the volume of business transacted by such individual in the City bears to the volume of business transacted by such individual within and without the City. 
	(c)	If it is impracticable, unreasonable or improper to apportion such payroll expenses as aforesaid either because of the particular nature of the services of such individual, or on account of the unusual basis of compensation, or for any other reason, then the amount of such payroll earnings reasonably attributable to work performed or services rendered in the City shall be determined on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case, in accordance with any rulings or regulations issued or promulgated by the Tax Collector for the purpose. 
	(d)	If the Tax Collector determines that the percentage of payroll expenses attributable to the City, for any one or more persons, is a relatively stable percentage, the Tax Collector may establish that percentage as a prima facie evidence of payroll expense attributable to the City; provided, that the Tax Collector shall condition the establishment of such fixed percentage upon the obligation of the taxpayer to report immediately to the Tax Collector any significant change in the taxpayer's mode of business which may impact the portion of the person's payroll expense which is attributable to the City; and, provided further, that the Tax Collector may rescind any such fixed percentage at any time by providing written notice to the taxpayer of such rescission.

	(c)	For the 2011 tax year, and each second succeeding tax year the Tax Collector shall increase the ceiling for the Small Business Tax Exemption (rounded to the nearest $10,000.00 increment) to reflect increases in the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index for all urban customers for the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose area for each of the preceding two tax years. 
	(d)	In lieu of the penalty specified in Section 6.17-3 of this Article for failing to file a return, any person who otherwise qualifies for the small business exemption set forth in this Section who fails to file a return by the last date of February shall pay a penalty as follows: 
		(1)	If the person's Payroll Expense Tax liability under this Article, but for the small business exemption under this section, would be less than $1.000.00, the penalty shall be $100.00 plus 10% of the amount of such liability, for each month, or fraction thereof, that the return is delinquent, up to a maximum amount equal to the person's liability for such tax but for the small business exemption; 
		(2)	If the person's Payroll Expense Tax liability under this Article, but for the small business exemption under this section, would be $1,000.00 or more, then the penalty shall be $250.00 plus 10% of the amount of such liability, for each month, or fraction thereof, that the return is delinquent, up to a maximum amount equal to the person's liability for such tax but for the small business exemption. 
	(e)	The Tax Collector may, in his or her discretion, reduce the penalty set forth in Subsection (c) to not less than $100.00 upon a showing that the late filing of the return was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

		(6)	Any person upon whom the City is prohibited under the Constitution or statute of the state of California from imposing the Payroll Expense Tax. 
	(f)	To the extent that any taxpayer has paid a substantially similar tax to any other taxing jurisdiction on any payroll expense taxed under this Article, the tax paid to such taxing jurisdiction shall be credited against the tax due under this Article. 
	(g)	Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring the payment of any tax for engaging in a business or the doing of an act when such payment would be in violation of the Constitution or a statute of the United States or of the Constitution or a statute of the State of California.

SEC. 950.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
	The voters hereby find and declare as follows:
	1.	San Francisco is the only major city in California that levies its entire business tax on payroll expense. This exclusive payroll-based tax discourages job creation and economic growth, lowers wages, and provides an unstable revenue stream.
	2.	San Francisco currently charges a flat rate on its payroll expense tax base. Instituting a tiered rate structure, in which businesses are taxed based on their gross receipts, will better distribute the tax burden according to a business's ability to pay.
	3.	Gross receipts is the most common business tax base among California's largest cities.
	4.	Amending San Francisco's business tax system to include a gross receipts tax will promote revenue stability by diversifying the tax base.
	5.	The rate schedules and the small business exemption for businesses with receipts under $1,000,000 provide particular tax relief to small businesses.
	6.	The legislation will gradually phase in the new gross receipts tax over a five-year period, beginning in tax year 2014, to allow businesses time to adjust to the change and to minimize the risk to the City and to taxpayers of instability in City revenues during the transition from the payroll expense tax to a gross receipts tax.
	7.	Also beginning in tax year 2014, the payroll expense tax will be adjusted, over the same period, in increments that are consistent with the phase in of the gross receipts tax.
	8.	Each year during the phase-in period, the formula dictates an increase in the gross receipts tax rate and an adjustment in the payroll expense tax rate that is expected to reduce the payroll expense tax rate to zero by or before 2018. The Controller will calculate the annual increase in the gross receipts tax rate and the adjustment in the payroll expense tax rate by applying formulas specified in this legislation.

SEC. 952.3.  GROSS RECEIPTS.
	(a)	"Gross receipts" means the total amounts received or accrued by a person from whatever source derived, including, but not limited to, amounts derived from sales, services, dealings in property, interest, rent, royalties, dividends, licensing fees, other fees, commissions and distributed amounts from other business entities. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article, gross receipts includes but is not limited to all amounts that constitute gross income for federal income tax purposes. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article, gross receipts includes all receipts, cash, credits and property of any kind or nature and including any amount for which credit is allowed by the seller to the purchaser, without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of materials used, labor or service costs, interest paid or payable, losses or any other expense whatsoever, except that cash discounts allowed or taken on sales shall not be included as gross receipts. Gross receipts, including advance payments, shall be included in a taxpayer's gross receipts at the time such receipts are recognized as gross income for federal income tax reporting purposes.
	(b)	"Gross receipts" with respect to any lease or rental shall include payment for any services that are part of the lease or rental, whether received in money or otherwise, that are paid to, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the lessor, and all receipts, cash, credits, property of any kind or character and the fair market value of services so paid or rendered by the lessee.
	(c)	Treatment of Taxes. "Gross receipts" shall not include the amount of any federal, state, or local tax imposed on or with respect to retail sales whether imposed upon the retailer or upon the purchaser and regardless of whether the amount of tax is stated as a separate charge, or such part of the sales price of any property previously sold and returned by the purchaser to the seller which is refunded by the seller by way of cash or credit allowances given or taken as part payment on any property so accepted for resale. Gross receipts shall also not include any federal, state or local tax imposed upon a person for which that person is reimbursed by means of a separately stated charge to a purchaser, lessee, licensee or customer. Gross receipts shall not include any amount of third-party taxes that a taxpayer collects from or on behalf of the taxpayer's customers and remits to the appropriate governmental entity imposing such tax. Gross receipts shall not include any tax refunds received by a person from a governmental entity. Gross receipts shall include any federal, state or local tax not specifically excluded in this subsection.
	(d)	"Gross receipts" shall not include any amount received from or charged to any person that is a related entity to the taxpayer. Nor shall gross receipts include any grants received from governmental entities or any gifts. Gross receipts shall not include any investment receipts. "Investment receipts" includes interest, dividends, capital gains, other amounts received on account of financial instruments, and distributions from business entities, provided such items are directly derived exclusively from the investment of capital and not from the sale of property other than financial instruments, or from the provision of services, to any person. Gross receipts also shall not include any allocations of income or gain, or distributions (such as dividends, interest and other returns on capital) from an entity treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes, provided such allocations or distributions are derived exclusively from an investment in such entity, and not from any other property sold to, or services provided to, such entity. Any gross receipts of a pass-through entity which is subject to the gross receipts tax shall not also constitute gross receipts of any owner of that entity.
	(e)	Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), "gross receipts" from the sale or exchange of stocks or other similar written instruments evidencing a right to participate in the assets of any business, or of bonds or other evidence of indebtedness, or of any other marketable securities (collectively referred to in this Article as "financial instruments"), or of any real property, shall not include the cost to acquire the financial instrument(s), or real property, sold or otherwise exchanged or converted. Nor shall "gross receipts" include the amount received by the original issuer of a financial instrument in exchange for such issuance. To the extent that any loss on the sale or exchange of financial instruments reduces the gross income of a person for federal income tax purposes in the year the loss is incurred, that loss shall reduce gross receipts from the sale or exchange of financial instruments, but in no event shall those receipts be less than zero, and in no event may any such loss be carried back or carried forward to reduce gross receipts in a tax year other than that in which the loss was incurred.
	(f)	No person shall be deemed to be engaging in business in the City if that person is an individual whose only gross receipts within the City are derived from investments of that individual's own funds in financial instruments. Gross receipts of an individual shall not include interest, dividends, capital gains and similar items or investment income earned from the investment of that individual's own capital.
	(g)	For purposes of this Article and Article 12, and notwithstanding Section 6.2-12 of Article 6, no person shall be deemed to be engaging in business within the City if its activities in the City consist solely of one or more of the following:
		(1)	contracting with, acting through, or otherwise using the services of, any investment advisor or affiliate thereof which is not a related entity;
		(2)	maintaining documents of formation, incorporation, or registration within the City;
		(3)	being an owner, member, or other participant in an entity engaging in business within the City which is a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes; or

For purposes of this Article, if two or more persons derive gross receipts solely from sources within California, and their business activities are such that, if conducted both within and outside California, a combined report would be required under the California Revenue and Taxation Code, or any successor, then those persons are related entities regardless of whether they file a combined report under the California Revenue and Taxation Code, or successor.

	(c)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, in any year in which the payroll expense tax rate determined under Section 903.1 of Article 12-A is zero, the gross receipts tax rates for that year and all future years shall be as the Controller computed for that year, except that for tax year 2021 and all future years, the rate under Section 953.7(a), for gross receipts over $25,000,000 only, shall be the sum of the rate established under this Section 959(c) and 0.025%. In no event shall the rate established under Section 953.7(a) by the preceding sentence, for gross receipts over $25,000,000, exceed 0.325%. The Controller shall certify and publish such rates by September 1 of that year.
	(d)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the gross receipts tax rates for 2019 and all future years shall be the rates in effect in tax year 2018, except that for tax year 2021 and all future years, the rate under Section 953.7(a), for gross receipts over $25,000,000 only, shall be the sum of the rate established under this Section 959(c) and 0.025%. In no event shall the rate established under Section 953.7(a) by the preceding sentence, for gross receipts over $25,000,000, exceed 0.325%.

SEC. 960.  THE "PAYROLL EXPENSE TAX EXCLUSION" CREDIT.
	(a)	"Payroll Expense Tax Exclusion Credit" means the dollar amount by which a person would have been able to reduce its payroll expense tax liability pursuant to the Enterprise Zone Tax Credit under Section 906A of Article 12-A, the Biotechnology Exclusion under Section 906.1 of Article 12-A, and/or the Clean Technology Business Exclusion under Section 906.2 of Article 12-A, as if the payroll expense tax were in full force and effect and calculated at a rate of 1½ percent.
	(b)	"Combined Business Tax Liability" means the sum of the gross receipts tax and the payroll expense tax a person owes for a tax year.
	(c)	For so long as a particular payroll expense tax exclusion listed under subsection (a) is in effect, without regard to whether the payroll expense tax is otherwise in effect, a person may credit against its combined business tax liability for a tax year the amount of a particular payroll expense tax exclusion credit to which it would be entitled under the payroll expense tax; however, in no event shall such credit reduce a person's combined business tax liability to less than zero. Any person who claims the credit under this Section must meet all of the eligibility requirements of the payroll expense tax exclusion(s) it claims. The credit may be claimed against the tax liability only of the person who qualified for the payroll expense tax exclusion and not against any liability of related entities or other members of that person's combined group.

	(c)	For so long as the Central Market Street and Tenderloin Area Payroll Expense Tax Exclusion is in effect, without regard to whether the payroll expense tax is otherwise in effect, a person shall owe the lesser of its combined business tax liability or the amount of its Central Market Street limit. Any person who claims the Central Market Street and Tenderloin Area Payroll Expense Tax Exclusion must meet all of the eligibility requirements of that exclusion.

SEC. 1021.   REFUND.
	(a)	Any person who paid any tax measured by gross receipts under former Article 12-B, at a rate specified in Sections 1004.01 through 1004.18, inclusive, as it read at the time payment was due for the tax year commencing on January 1, 2000 and ending on December 31, 2000 (the 2000 tax year), and who files within six months of the effective date of this Article a verified claim for refund thereof, on a form prescribed by the Tax Collector, shall be allowed a refund in an amount and in a manner determined under this Article. 
	(b)	The Tax Collector shall notify every person who paid a tax measured by gross receipts as described in Subsection (a) of this Section, at the person's last known address, that such tax has been repealed, and that such person may be entitled to a refund. The Tax Collector shall furnish such person with a form upon which to claim the refund specified in this Article. 
(Added by Ord. 63-01, File No. 010274, App. 4/25/2001)
SEC. 1022.   DETERMINATION OF REFUND.
	(a)	Amount of Refund. For the tax year commencing on January 1, 2000 and ending on December 31, 2000 (the 2000 tax year), the City shall refund an amount equal to the excess of a person's actual tax payments to the City under former Article 12-B as it read at the time payment was due for such tax year over the sum of the person's lesser liability under the Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance for such tax year and the person's outstanding tax obligations to the City, if any. A person's lesser liability under the Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance for the 2000 tax year shall be an amount equal to the liability that such person would have incurred under the Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance in such tax year but for the exemption set forth in Section 917.1 of the Business and Tax Regulations Code as that section read on December 31, 2000. If a person paid penalties for the 2000 tax year that were calculated as a percentage of the person's tax liability as measured by gross receipts for such tax year, then the City shall provide a refund for such penalties in an amount equal to the penalty actually paid, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of the tax actually paid over the person's lesser liability under the Payroll Expense Tax Ordinance and the denominator of which is the amount of tax the person actually paid under former Article 12-B for such tax year. The amount of any refund required by this Article shall earn interest thereon at the rate specified in Section 6.15-2 of Article 6 of the San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code pursuant to Tax Collector ruling(s). The refund shall be paid to the person in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (b) of this Section. 
	(b)	Payment of Refund. The amount the City shall refund to each person pursuant to Subsection (a) of this Section shall be paid within six (6) months of receipt by the Tax Collector of a complete verified claim establishing the person's entitlement to the refund pursuant to this Article. 
	(c)	Small Business Exemption. For the 2000 tax year, persons may qualify for the Small Business Exemption set forth in Section 905A of Article 12-A of the Business and Tax Regulations Code as it read on December 31, 2000, as a result of the reduction of the person's liability for such tax year resulting from the retroactive repeal of former Article 12-B of the Business and Tax Regulations Code. 
(Added by Ord. 63-01, File No. 010274, App. 4/25/2001)
SEC. 1023.   AUTHORITY TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS.

SEC. 1030.  INITIAL OPTION.
	Commencing in tax year 1990, any business, as defined in Section 1002.1 of this Code, that is subject to the Payroll Expense Tax or the Business Tax may elect to designate up to one percent of its tax liability for deposit in the Neighborhood Beautification and Graffiti Clean-up Fund. 
(Added by Proposition D, 6/5/90)
SEC. 1031.  AMOUNT OF FUND ANNUALLY.
	It is the intent of the voters of the City and County of San Francisco that one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), derived from tax proceeds designated by the taxpayers pursuant to Section 1031, shall be deposited annually in the Neighborhood Beautification and Graffiti Clean-up Fund. The Controller shall annually adjust this figure for inflation to reflect changes in the most recently available U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers for the San Francisco-Oakland-San José Metropolitan Area, or its successor index. 
(Added by Proposition D, 6/5/90)
SEC. 1032.  SUBSEQUENT OPTION.
	For each tax year after 1990, the Controller shall determine the amount of fund revenues actually generated in the prior year, including the interest thereon and the balance, if any, remaining at the close of the tax year. On the basis of the prior year's experience of taxpayer contributions and total revenues generated by the payroll expense and business taxes, the Controller shall calculate a percentage ceiling of total tax liability which taxpayers may designate for deposit in the fund the following tax year. The Controller shall set the percentage ceiling so that the revenues produced thereby are most likely to generate a total of one million dollars (adjusted for inflation) in the fund for the forthcoming tax year. The Controller shall transmit his or her calculation to the Board of Supervisors, which shall adopt a new tax designation ceiling, if necessary, in advance of the tax year to enable the Tax Collector to perform his or her collection duties. 
(Added by Proposition D, 6/5/90)
SEC. 1033.  SEVERABILITY.
	If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this initiative ordinance or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this initiative ordinance or any part thereof. The People of the City and County of San Francisco hereby declare that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective. In addition, the voters declare their intention that should any portion of this initiative ordinance or all of it be declared invalid in whole or in part, such invalidity shall have no effect upon the continued validity of the Payroll Expense Tax and Business Tax.

SEC. 1115.1.  LIEN PROCEEDINGS.
Editor's Note:
	The provisions of this version of Section 1115.1 apply until January 1, 2013. The text of Section 1115.1 that is operative on January 1, 2013 appears after this version. 
	(a)	Initiating Lien Proceedings. If the full amount of the delinquent tax, penalties and interest is not paid within 30 days following mailing of the delinquency notice or, in the event of an appeal to the Transfer Tax Review Board, within 10 days following service or mailing of the Review Board's ruling, the County Recorder, within one year of when the tax became delinquent, shall report the delinquency to the Board of Supervisors ("the Board") and request the Board to initiate proceedings to impose a lien for the total unpaid balance against the real property that was transferred by the document delivered without full payment of tax. Said report shall, for each delinquent account, contain the names of the persons liable for the tax, the total amount due, including delinquent taxes, penalties and interest, and a description of the real property that was transferred by the document delivered without full payment of tax. Upon receipt of such report the Board shall fix a time and place for hearing the report and any protests or objections thereto and shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed not less than 10 days prior to the date of hearing to each person liable for the tax and to the owner or owners of the real property described in the recorded notice of delinquent tax. 
	(b)	Hearing. At the time so fixed, the Board shall meet to hear the report and any protests or objections thereto. The Board may make such revisions, corrections or modifications of the report as it may deem just; and in the event that the Board is satisfied with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified), it shall be confirmed. The decision of the Board on the report and on all protests or objections thereto shall be final and conclusive; provided, however, any delinquent account may be removed from the report by payment in full at any time prior to confirmation of the report. The Clerk of the Board shall cause the confirmed report to be verified in form sufficient to meet recording requirements. 
	(c)	Special Assessment Lien. Upon confirmation of the report by the Board, the unpaid balance reported therein, including tax, penalties and interest, shall constitute a special assessment against the real property that was transferred by the document delivered without full payment of tax; provided, however, that the special assessment, and the lien created thereby, shall attach only to interests in the property that were held, on the date the notice of delinquent tax was recorded, by persons liable for the tax. Each such assessment shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon such parcels and paramount to all other liens except those for State, County and municipal taxes with which it shall be in parity. The lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest and penalties due and payable thereon are paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to said special assessment. The Clerk of the Board shall give notice of the confirmation of the report to each person liable for the tax and to the owner-or owners of the real property described in the recorded notice of delinquent tax and shall cause the confirmed and verified report to be recorded in the County Recorder's office and the special assessment lien on each parcel of property described in the report shall thereupon secure an additional charge for administrative expenses of $50 or 10 percent of the unpaid balance, whichever is higher. An action to set aside the special assessment and the lien created thereby shall be commenced within one year from and after the date that notice of the confirmation of the report was given to the persons liable for the tax and to the property owners. 
	(d)	Filing with Controller and Tax Collector. The Clerk of the Board shall file a certified copy of each confirmed report with the Controller and Tax Collector within 10 days after confirmation of the report, whereupon it shall be the duty of said officers to add the amount of each special assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied for municipal purposes against the respective parcels of property described in the confirmed report. 
	(e)	Payment of Special Assessment. On payment to the Tax Collector of the special assessment, including delinquent taxes, accrued penalties, interest and the administrative expense charge authorized by Subdivision (c) above, the Tax Collector shall cause a Release of Lien to be recorded with the County Recorder and shall pay the statutory recording fee from the administrative expense charge. Except for the fee paid to record the Release of Lien, all sums collected by the Tax Collector pursuant to this ordinance shall be deposited to the General Fund. 
	(f)	The provisions of this Section shall only apply until January 1, 2013, when the alternative version of Section 1115.1 adopted in Ordinance No. 20-09 shall take effect.

	(b)	Hearing. At the time so fixed, the Board shall meet to hear the report and any protests or objections thereto. The Board may make such revisions, corrections or modifications of the report as it may deem just; and in the event that the Board is satisfied with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified), it shall be confirmed. The decision of the Board on the report and on all protests or objections thereto shall be final and conclusive; provided, however, any delinquent account may be removed from the report by payment in full at any time prior to confirmation of the report.

An action to set aside the special assessment and the lien created thereby shall be commenced within one year from and after the date that notice of the confirmation of the report was given to the persons liable for the tax and to the property owners. 
	(d)	Filing with Controller and Tax Collector. The Clerk of the Board shall file a certified copy of each confirmed report with the Controller and Tax Collector within 10 days after confirmation of the report, whereupon it shall be the duty of said officers to add the amount of each special assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied for municipal purposes against the respective parcels of property described in the confirmed report. 
	(e)	Payment of Special Assessment. On payment to the Tax Collector of the special assessment, including delinquent taxes, accrued penalties, interest and the administrative expense charge authorized by Subdivision (c) above, the Tax Collector shall cause a Release of Lien to be recorded with the County Recorder and shall pay the statutory recording fee from the administrative expense charge.

	(a)	State law provides procedures to form property and business improvement districts and levy assessments. This Article provides authority for the City to augment and modify those state law procedures by authorizing the Board of Supervisors to do any of the following:
		(1)	Reduce the percentage of petitions required from owners in order to initiate formation;
		(2)	Have the district encompass residential property, and to assess residential property;
		(3)	Extend the term of the district to a maximum of 15 years, or such longer term as is authorized by state law;
		(4)	Extend the term of the district to a maximum of 40 years, if all or a portion of the assessments will be pledged or applied to pay any bond, financing lease (including certificates of participation therein), or other similar obligations of the City;
		(5)	Recover through assessments the costs incurred in formation of the district;
		(6)	Disestablish a district upon a supermajority vote of the Board of Supervisors; or,
		(7)	Require a weighted two-thirds (2/3) vote of business owners to be assessed, based on ballots cast, as an alternative or additional procedure for establishing a business improvement district and levying assessments on business owners.
		In addition, this Article augments and modifies state law by: requiring the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors to notify business owners in English, Cantonese and Spanish when a petition for district formation is received; and setting minimum levels of representation by business owners on the governing body of the owners' association that administers, implements or provides the activities and improvements specified in the management district plan.
	(b)	Under this Article, the Board of Supervisors may establish property and business improvement districts and may finance activities and improvements through assessments apportioned among parcels of real property and/or businesses within such districts. It is the intent of this Article to provide a vehicle for financing activities and improvements that supplement and complement existing services and facilities. The Board of Supervisors may not establish any district or levy any assessment under this Article to replace or supplant existing City services. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as prohibiting the establishment of districts or levying of assessments to finance local capital improvements that are otherwise authorized under the City Charter, any other City ordinance, or state law.

	(a)	Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36621(a) or any other provision of state law to the contrary, the Board of Supervisors may initiate proceedings to establish a property and business improvement district upon receipt of a petition signed by property owners, business owners, or a combination of property owners and business owners in the proposed district who will pay at least 30 percent of the assessments proposed to be levied.
		(1)	The amount of assessments attributable to properties and businesses owned by the same owner that is in excess of 25 percent of all assessments proposed to be levied, shall not be included in determining whether the petition is signed by the property owners or business owners who will pay the requisite 30 percent or more of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied.
		(2)	Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36623(b) or any other provision of state law to the contrary, where the Board of Supervisors initiates proceedings pursuant to this subsection (a) to levy assessments on businesses, the Board shall conduct the protest proceeding by ballot rather than by oral or written protests.
	(b)	Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36622(h) or any other provision of state law to the contrary, the Board of Supervisors may form a district and levy assessments:
		(1)	For a maximum term of up to 15 years, or such longer term as is authorized by state law; or,
		(2)	For a maximum term of up to 40 years, if all or a portion of the assessments will be pledged or applied to pay any bond, financing lease (including any certificates of participation therein), or other similar obligations of the City. Such assessments may be pledged or applied to pay such obligations commencing when the assessments are levied, or such later date as the Board of Supervisors shall determine.
	(c)	Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36632(c) or any other provision of state law to the contrary, the Board of Supervisors may: 
		(1)	establish a district pursuant to this Article that encompasses properties zoned for residential use;
		(2)	levy assessments upon such properties; and
		(3)	fund improvements and activities that benefit such properties.
	(d)	Notwithstanding any provision of state law to the contrary, the Board of Supervisors may authorize a district formed pursuant to this Article to recover through assessments the costs incurred in forming the district, including but not limited to:
		(1)	The costs of preparation of the management district plan and engineer's report required by state law;
		(2)	The costs of circulating and submitting the petition to the Board of Supervisors seeking establishment of the district;
		(3)	The costs of printing, advertising and the giving of published, posted or mailed notices;
		(4)	The costs of engineering, consulting, legal or other professional services provided in proceedings under this Article or Streets and Highways Code Sections 36600 et seq.; and
		(5)	Costs of any ballot proceedings required by this Article 15 or other law for approval of a new or increased assessment.
		In order to recover these costs, the management district plan required pursuant to Streets and Highways Code Section 36622 shall specify the formation costs eligible for recovery through assessments, the schedule for recovery of those costs, and the basis for determining the amount of the additional assessment for recovery of such costs, including the maximum amount of the additional assessment, expressed either as a dollar amount, or as a percentage of the underlying assessment.
	(e)	Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36670 or any other provision of state law to the contrary, the Board of Supervisors may, by a supermajority vote of eight or more members, notice a hearing and initiate proceedings to disestablish for any reason a district formed after April 4, 2004. Where the Board of Supervisors seeks to disestablish a district in circumstances not authorized under Streets and Highways Code Section 36670, both the resolution of intention to disestablish the district and any final resolution to disestablish the district shall require a supermajority vote of no fewer than eight members.
	(f)	The Board of Supervisors, however, may not disestablish a district under Section 1511(e) or Streets and Highways Code Section 36670 or any other provision of law, where there are any outstanding bond, financing lease (including any certificates of participation therein), or other similar obligations of the City, payable from or secured by assessments levied within the district.
	(g)	Notwithstanding Streets and Highways Code Section 36640 or any other provision of state law to the contrary:
		(1)	The Board of Supervisors may, in the resolution to establish the district, determine and declare that any bond, financing lease (including any certificates of participation therein), or other similar obligations of the City, shall be issued to finance the estimated costs of some or all of the proposed improvements or activities described in such resolution, pursuant to the City Charter, City ordinances or state law, as the Board may determine; and
		(2)	The amount (including interest) of any City bond, financing lease (including any certificates of participation therein) or other similar obligations, may not exceed the estimated total of (A) revenues to be raised from the assessments over the term of the district, plus (B)	such other monies, if any, to be available for such purpose, in each case determined as of the date such obligations are issued or incurred.
	(h)	The management district plan submitted for each proposed district to be funded under this Article shall ensure adequate representation on the governing body of the owners' association, of business owners located within the district who do not own, or have an ownership interest in, commercial property located within the district. Not less than 20 percent of voting members of the owners' association shall be such business owners. Where warranted by the circumstances in a proposed district, the Board of Supervisors may require that the management district plan provide a greater level of business owner representation. This subsection (h) shall not limit the authority of the Board of Supervisors to require the incorporation of any other item or matter into the management district plan under Streets and Highways Code Section 36622(l) or other applicable law.
	(i)	No fewer than 30 days after the Clerk of the Board receives a complete petition seeking formation of a district pursuant to this Article, the Clerk shall mail notice to all businesses located within the proposed district holding a current registration certificate issued by the Tax Collector. The notice shall be in English, Spanish and Cantonese, and shall inform the recipients:
		(1)	That a petition for formation of a property and business improvement district has been received;
		(2)	That if the district is formed, assessments will be levied against property and/or businesses in the district;
		(3)	That formation of the district is subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors following public hearings and a ballot proceeding by owners of the property, businesses, or both, subject to the assessment; and,
		(4)	How recipients may obtain further information about the petition and proposed district.

ARTICLE 23:
VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE EXPENDITURE PLAN
Sec. 2301.Title.Sec. 2302.Definitions.Sec. 2303.Purpose.Sec. 2304.Effective Date.Sec. 2305.Increase of $10 in the Annual Motor Vehicle Registration Fee.Sec. 2306.Responsibilities and Powers of the Authority.Sec. 2307.Contract with Department of Motor Vehicles.Sec. 2308.Use of Proceeds.Sec. 2309.Severability.
SEC. 2301.  TITLE.
	This ordinance shall be known as the "Vehicle Registration Fee Ordinance." 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2302.  DEFINITIONS.
	For the purpose of this Vehicle Registration Fee Ordinance, the following words shall have the meanings set forth below. 
	(a)	"Authority." The San Francisco County Transportation Authority.
	(b)	"Board." The Authority Board of Commissioners.
	(c)	"Expenditure Plan." The "SB83 Additional Vehicle Registration Fee Expenditure Plan," approved by the Board on June 29, 2010, to set the transportation projects and programs funded over the next 30 years with the revenues of the fee increase, as well as other allowable costs on which the Authority may spend the proceeds of the $10 vehicle registration fee increase authorized by Section 2305. The Expenditure Plan specifies eligibility and other conditions and criteria under which the proceeds of the fee increase are available, and provides for the adoption of future Expenditure Plan updates. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2303.  PURPOSE.
	The City and County of San Francisco has very significant unfunded transportation needs and this $10 vehicle registration fee increase would provide a stable source of funding to meet some of those needs. The fee is expected to generate approximately $5 million annually that the Authority would use to fund projects and programs under the Expenditure Plan that mitigate congestion and pollution caused by motor vehicles in San Francisco. These projects and programs could include repairing local streets and roads, improving Muni's reliability, pedestrian safety improvements, smart traffic signal technology to prioritize transit and manage traffic incidents, and programs that encourage people to use more sustainable forms of transportation, e.g. transit, bicycle, carpool or on foot. All of the projects and programs must have a relationship or benefit to the persons paying the fee. The Expenditure Plan contains guiding principles intended to, among other objectives, focus on funding smaller, high-impact projects that will quickly provide tangible benefits; provide a fair geographic distribution that takes into account the various needs of San Francisco's neighborhoods; and ensure accountability and transparency in programming and delivery. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2304.  EFFECTIVE DATE.
	The Vehicle Registration Fee Ordinance shall be effective at the close of the polls in the City and County of San Francisco on the day of the election scheduled for November 2, 2010. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2305.  INCREASE OF $10 IN THE ANNUAL MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE.
	Beginning six months after the Effective Date, the motor vehicle registration fee for all motor vehicles registered in the City and County of San Francisco is increased by $10 each year, for each original vehicle registration and each vehicle registration renewal. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2306.  RESPONSIBILITIES AND POWERS OF THE AUTHORITY.
	The Authority shall have all of the powers set forth in California Government Code Section 65089.20, all of the powers set forth in the Expenditure Plan, and all powers incidental or necessary to imposing and collecting the fee increase authorized under Section 2305, administering the fee proceeds, the Expenditure Plan, and the projects and programs under that Expenditure Plan, and delivering the transportation improvements in the Expenditure Plan. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2307.  CONTRACT WITH DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES.
	Consistent with California Vehicle Code Section 9250.4, the Authority shall request and contract with the California Department of Motor Vehicles for the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect and distribute to the Authority the fee imposed under Section 2305, upon the original registration or renewal of registration of all motor vehicles registered in the City and County of San Francisco. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2308.  USE OF PROCEEDS.
	(a)	The Authority shall use the proceeds of the fees under Section 2305 solely for the projects, programs and purposes set forth in the Expenditure Plan. Pursuant to California Government Code section 65089.20 and as specified in the Expenditure Plan, the Authority shall use not more than five percent of the fee proceeds for administrative costs associated with the programs and projects, including amending the Expenditure Plan. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
SEC. 2309.  SEVERABILITY.
	If any of the provisions of this ordinance or the application of those provisions to persons or circumstances shall be held invalid, the remainder of those sections or the application of those provisions to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid shall not be affected thereby. 
(Added by Prop. AA, App. 11/2/2010)
