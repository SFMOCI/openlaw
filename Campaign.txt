SEC. 1.100.  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
	(a)	Huge sums of money often are necessary to finance American election campaigns. Inherent to the high cost of election campaigning is the problem of improper influence, real or potential, exercised by campaign contributors over elected officials. In addition, this fundraising distracts public officials seeking reelection from focusing upon important public matters, encourages contributions which may have a corrupting influence, gives incumbents an unfair fundraising advantage over potential challengers, and provides contributors with greater access to public officials than other members of the public. These developments undermine the integrity of the governmental process and the competitiveness of campaigns. The amount of money raised by many candidates and committees supporting or opposing candidates also erodes public confidence in local officials by creating the appearance that elected officials may be unduly influenced by contributors who support their campaigns or oppose their opponents' campaigns. 
	(b)	It is the purpose and intent of the People of the City and County of San Francisco in enacting this Chapter to:
		(1)	Place realistic and enforceable limits on the amount individuals may contribute to political campaigns in municipal elections and to provide full and fair enforcement of all the provisions in this Chapter; 
		(2)	Ensure that all individuals and interest groups in our city have a fair opportunity to participate in elective and governmental processes; 
		(3)	Create an incentive to limit overall expenditures in campaigns, thereby reducing the pressure on candidates to raise large campaign war chests for defensive purposes beyond the amount necessary to communicate reasonably with voters; 
		(4)	Reduce the advantage of incumbents and thus encourage competition for elective office;
		(5)	Allow candidates and officeholders to spend a smaller proportion of their time on fundraising and a greater proportion of their time dealing with issues of importance to their constituents' community; 
		(6)	Ensure that serious candidates are able to raise enough money to communicate their views and positions adequately to the public, thereby promoting public discussion of the important issues involved in political campaigns; 
		(7)	Limit contributions to candidates and committees, including committees that make independent expenditures, to eliminate or reduce the appearance or reality that large contributors may exert undue influence over elected officials; 
		(8)	Assist voters in making informed electoral decisions and ensure compliance with campaign contribution limits through the required filing of campaign statements detailing the sources of campaign contributions and how those contributions have been expended; 
		(9)	Make it easier for the public, the media and election officials to efficiently review and compare campaign statements by requiring committees that meet certain financial thresholds to file copies of their campaign statements on designated electronic media; 
		(10)	Help restore public trust in governmental and electoral institutions; and
		(11)	Help ensure the integrity of the election process by prohibiting campaign advertisements that contain false endorsements of current and former public officials, candidates, political clubs, and organizations. Such false endorsements undermine the integrity of the electoral process by misleading and confusing voters about the actual support for or opposition to candidates or ballot measures and it is too burdensome for individual voters, inundated with campaign messages, to verify the accuracy of such claims and for persons whose positions are misrepresented to correct the misrepresentations close in time to the election. 
	(c)	This Chapter is enacted in accordance with the terms of Sections 5 and 7 of Article XI of the Constitution of the State of California and Section 1.101 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco.

	(a)	The Board of Supervisors finds that public disclosure of the identity and extent of efforts of lobbyists to influence decision-making regarding local legislative and administrative matters is essential to protect public confidence in the responsiveness and representative nature of government officials and institutions. It is the purpose and intent of the Board of Supervisors to impose reasonable registration and disclosure requirements to reveal information about lobbyists' efforts to influence decision-making regarding local legislative and administrative matters. 
	(b)	Corruption and the appearance of corruption in the form of campaign consultants exploiting their influence with City officials on behalf of private interests may erode public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of City governmental decisions. The City and County of San Francisco has a compelling interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption which could result in such erosion of public confidence. Prohibitions on campaign consultants lobbying current and former clients will protect public confidence in the electoral and governmental processes. It is the purpose and intent of the people of the City and County of San Francisco in enacting this Chapter to prohibit campaign consultants from exploiting or appearing to exploit their influence with City officials on behalf of private interests.

SEC. 3.200.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
	(a)	The people of the City and County of San Francisco declare that public office is a public trust and all officers and employees of the City and County shall exercise their public duties in a manner consistent with this trust. To assure that the governmental processes of the City and County promote fairness and equity for all residents and to maintain public trust in governmental institutions, the people of the City and County declare that they have a compelling interest in creating laws regulating conflicts of interest and outside activities of City officers and employees. 
	(b)	The proper operation of the government of the City and County of San Francisco requires that public officers and employees be independent, impartial, and responsible to the people and that public office and employment not be used for personal gain. The public interest, therefore, requires that officers and employees of the City and County be prohibited from making, participating in making or otherwise seeking to influence governmental decisions in which they have a financial interest or accepting gifts and other things of value from regulated sources. 
	(c)	In order to maintain the public's confidence in the integrity of governmental decisions related to the appointment and discipline of public officers and employees, public officers and employees must not give or receive anything of value in consideration of their appointment or accept anything of value from their subordinates, and must not participate in decisions related to their own character or conduct or that of their family members. 
	(d)	City and County contracts should be, and should appear to be, awarded on a fair and impartial basis. The practice of members of Boards and Commissions of the City and County contracting with the City and County creates the potential for, and the appearance of, favoritism or preferential treatment by the City and County. Prohibiting members of Boards and Commissions of the City and County from contracting with the City and County will eliminate both actual and perceived favoritism or preferential treatment without creating unnecessary barriers to public service. 
	(e)	Government decisions of officers and employees of the City and County should be, and should appear to be, made on a fair and impartial basis. The practice of former officers and employees communicating with their former colleagues on behalf of private interests and the practice of current officers of the City and County communicating with other officers and employees on behalf of any other person for compensation creates the potential for, and the appearance of, undue influence, favoritism or preferential treatment. Prohibiting former officers and employees from communicating orally, in writing, or in any other manner with their former colleagues for specified periods of time and prohibiting current officers from communicating orally, in writing, or in any other manner with other officers and employees of the City and County on behalf of any other person for compensation will eliminate both actual and perceived undue influence, favoritism or preferential treatment without creating unnecessary barriers to public service.

SEC. 4.100.  FINDINGS.
	The City and County of San Francisco has a paramount interest in protecting the integrity of its government institutions. To further this interest, individuals should be encouraged to report to the City's Ethics Commission, Controller, District Attorney, City Attorney and the complainant's department possible violations of laws, regulations and rules governing the conduct of City officers and employees. 
	This Chapter protects all City officers and employees from retaliation for filing a complaint with, or providing information to, the Ethics Commission, Controller, District Attorney, City Attorney or complainant's department about improper government activity by City officers and employees. 
	This Chapter ensures that complaints that do not allege a violation of law over which the Ethics Commission or Controller has jurisdiction are directed to the appropriate agency for investigation and possible disciplinary or enforcement action. 
	Finally, this Chapter implements Charter Appendix Section F1.107. Section F1.107 directs the Controller, as City Services Auditor, to administer a whistleblower program and investigate reports of complaints concerning the misuse of City funds, improper activities by City officers and employees, deficiencies in the quality and delivery of government services, and wasteful and inefficient City government practices.

	(f)	REPORT BY DEPARTMENT AND FURTHER ACTION BY CONTROLLER. If the Controller has recommended that a City department take disciplinary or other corrective action that the department has declined to take, the department shall report to the Controller its reasons for failing to do so within the timeframe that the Controller specifies for reporting on its investigation of the complaint.
