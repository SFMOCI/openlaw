Before the Commission determines the Supervisors' salary, it shall conduct and consider a salary survey of other full time California City Councils and County Boards of Supervisors and it may consider the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
	The Civil Service Commission shall timely transmit its determination of the Supervisors' salary to the Controller, so that funds can be set aside for that purpose. The Controller shall include the Civil Service Commission's determination in appropriate budget documents to insure implementation. This determination may not be changed except by the Civil Service Commission.

Decisions of the Zoning Administrator regarding zoning variances may be appealed to the Board of Appeals. 
	Before any such variance may be granted, there shall appear, and the Zoning Administrator shall specify in his or her findings, the facts in each case which shall establish:

	(c)	That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant, possessed by other property in the same zone and vicinity; 
	(d)	That the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such zone or district in which the property is located; and

Represent the City and County in legal proceedings with respect to which it has an interest; provided that any elected officer, department head, board or commission may engage counsel other than the City Attorney for legal advice regarding a particular matter where the elected officers department head, board or commission has reason to believe that the City Attorney may have a prohibited financial conflict of interest under California law or a prohibited ethical conflict of interest under the California Rules of Professional Conduct with regard to the matter, subject to the following limitations and conditions. 
		The elected officer, department head, board or commission shall first present a written request to the City Attorney for outside counsel. The written request shall specify the particular matter for which the elected officer, department head, board or commission seeks the services of outside counsel, a description of the requested scope of services, and the potential conflict of interest that is the basis for the request. Within five working days after receiving the written request for outside counsel, the City Attorney shall respond in writing to the elected officer, department head, board or commission either consenting or not consenting to the provision of outside counsel. If the City Attorney does not consent to the provision of outside counsel, the City Attorney shall state in the written response why he or she believes that there is no conflict of interest regarding the particular matter. 
		If the elected officer, department head, board or commission continues to believe there are adequate grounds for outside counsel despite the City Attorney's response that there is no conflict of interest, the elected officer, department head, board or commission may, within thirty days after receiving the City Attorney's response, refer the issue of whether the City Attorney has a prohibited conflict of interest regarding a particular matter to a retired judge or justice of the state courts of California for resolution. If the elected officer, department head, board or commission and City Attorney cannot agree on a retired judge to hear the matter, the retired judge shall be selected at random by an alternative dispute resolution provider. If the matter is referred to a retired judge, the elected officer, department head, board or commission, subject to the budgetary and fiscal provisions of the Charter, shall be entitled to retain outside counsel to represent it solely on the issue of whether the City Attorney has a conflict of interest regarding the particular matter.

The decision of the retired judge shall be final for the limited purpose of determining whether or not the elected officer, department head, board or commission may retain outside counsel for the particular matter. 
		If the retired judge decides that the City Attorney does not have a conflict of interest regarding the particular matter, the City Attorney shall continue to be the legal adviser to the elected officer, department head, board or commission for such matter. If the retired judge decides that the City Attorney has a conflict of interest regarding a particular matter, the elected officer, department head, board or commission shall be entitled to retain outside counsel for legal advice regarding the particular matter, and the City Attorney shall thereupon cease to advise the elected officer, department head board or commission on such matter. Any such finding of a conflict of interest shall not affect the City Attorney's role as legal advisor to the elected officer, department head, board or commission on all other matters. 
		If at any time after the retention of outside counsel, the City Attorney believes that there is no longer a conflict of interest, the City Attorney shall state in writing to the elected officer, department head, board or commission why he or she believes that there is no longer a conflict of interest. Within five working days after receiving the written statement from the City Attorney, the elected officer, department head, board or commission shall respond in writing, either agreeing or disagreeing that there is no longer a conflict of interest. If the elected officer, department head, board or commission agrees that there is no longer a conflict of interest regarding a particular matter, the elected officer, department head, board or commission shall cease employing outside counsel for legal advice regarding the matter, and the City Attorney shall serve as legal adviser to the elected officer, department head, board or commission regarding that matter. If the elected officer, department head, board or commission states in its written response that it believes the conflict of interest still exists, the City Attorney may, within ten working days after receiving the response of the elected officer, department head, board or commission, elect to refer the issue of whether the conflict of interest regarding the particular matter continues to exist to the same retired judge who originally heard the matter, if available. The same procedures as established herein shall apply thereafter. 
		In selecting outside counsel for any purpose described in this Section, the elected officer, department head, board or commission shall give preference to engaging the services of a City attorney's office, a County counsel's office or other public entity law office with an expertise regarding the subject-matter jurisdiction of the elected officer, department head, board or commission.

THE MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY
Sec. 8A.100.Preamble.Sec. 8A.101.Municipal Transportation Agency.Sec. 8A.102.Governance and Duties.Sec. 8A.103.Service Standards and Accountability.Sec. 8A.104.Personnel and Merit System.Sec. 8A.105.Municipal Transportation Fund.Sec. 8A.106.Budget.Sec. 8A.107.Municipal Transportation Quality Review.Sec. 8A.108.Fare Changes and Route Abandonments.Sec. 8A.109.Additional Sources of Revenue.Sec. 8A.110.Planning and Zoning.Sec. 8A.111.Citizens' Advisory Council.Sec. 8A.112.Parking and Traffic.Sec. 8A.113.Parking and Traffic; Governance.Sec. 8A.114.Cable Cars.Sec. 8A.115.Transit-First Policy.
SEC. 8A.100.  PREAMBLE.
	(a)	An effective, efficient, and safe transportation system is vital for San Francisco to achieve its goals for quality of life, environmental sustainability, public health, social justice, and economic growth. The Municipal Transportation Agency must manage San Francisco's transportation system which includes automobile, freight, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian networks to help the City meet those goals. Through this measure, the voters seek to provide the Municipal Transportation Agency with improved resources and expanded independence and authority in order to create a transportation system that is among the best in the world. 
	(b)	This article requires the Municipal Transportation Agency to develop clear, meaningful and quantifiable measures of its performance and goals and to regularly publicize those standards. This article also recognizes that the workers of the Municipal Transportation Agency are vital to the success of the Agency and to achieving the improvements voters seek. Therefore, it authorizes incentives for excellence and requires accountability for both managers and employees. 
	(c)	Specifically, San Francisco residents require:
		1.	Reliable, safe, timely, frequent, and convenient transit service to all neighborhoods;
		2.	A reduction in breakdowns, delays, over-crowding, preventable accidents;
		3.	Clean and comfortable transit vehicles and stations, operated by competent, courteous, and well trained employees;
		4.	Support and accommodation of the special transportation needs of the elderly and the disabled;
		5.	Protection from crime and inappropriate passenger behavior on the Municipal Railway;
		6.	Responsive, efficient, and accountable management;
		7.	Roads that are not gridlocked with congestion;
		8.	A safe and comprehensive network of bicycle lanes;
		9.	A safe and inviting environment for pedestrians;
		10.	Efficient movement of goods and deliveries;
		11.	A transportation sector that promotes environmental sustainability and does not contribute to global warming; and
		12.	A well-managed and well-coordinated transportation system that contributes to a livable urban environment.
		Through this measure, the voters seek to provide the transportation system with the resources, independence and focus necessary to achieve these goals. 
	(d)	The voters find that one of the impediments to achieving these goals in the past has been that responsibility for transportation has been diffused throughout City government. Accordingly, this Article places within the Municipal Transportation Agency the powers and duties relating to transit now vested in other departments, boards, and commissions of the City and County. This Article further requires that, to the extent other City and County agencies provide services to the Municipal Transportation Agency, those departments must give the highest priority to the delivery of such services. 
	(e)	At the same time, this Article is intended to ensure sufficient oversight of the Municipal Transportation Agency by, among other things, preserving the role of the City's Controller as to financial matters, the City Attorney as to legal matters, and the Civil Service Commission, as to merit system issues. In addition, this Article requires that outside audits be performed to ensure that required service levels are obtained with a minimum of waste. 
	(f)	Finally, this Article is intended to strengthen the Municipal Transportation Agency's authority to: 1) manage its employees; 2) establish efficient and economical work rules and work practices that maximize the Agency's responsiveness to public needs; and 3) protect the Agency's right to select, train, promote, demote, discipline, layoff and terminate employees, managers, and supervisors based upon the highest standards of customer service, efficiency and competency. 
	(g)	The effective management of traffic flow and parking are vital to the operation of the Municipal Railway. Congestion on city streets causes delays in transit operations. Therefore, the Municipal Transportation Agency must manage parking and traffic flow to ensure that transit vehicles move through City streets safely and efficiently. 
	(h)	In addition, the residents of San Francisco require that the Agency: 1) value and protect the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists; 2) reduce congestion and air pollution through efficient use of the streets; and 3) protect the City's economic health by giving priority to commercial deliveries and access to local businesses. 
	(i)	The voters find that reducing the carbon emissions from San Francisco's transit sector is fundamental to the City's health and wellbeing and shall be among the Agency's policy priorities. Because the Agency has significant influence on San Francisco's transportation sector, which is responsible for fully half of the carbon emissions produced within the City, the voters direct the Agency to develop and implement strategies for substantially reducing those emissions. The voters further affirm the goals of the City's Climate Action Plan. 
	(j)	This Article shall be interpreted and applied in conformance with the above goals.
(Added November 1999; Amended by Proposition A, Approved 11/6/2007)
SEC. 8A.101.  MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY.
	(a)	There shall be a Municipal Transportation Agency. The Agency shall include a Board of Directors and a Director of Transportation. The Agency shall include the Municipal Railway and the former Department of Parking and Traffic, as well as any other departments, bureaus or operating divisions hereafter created or placed under the Agency. There shall also be a Citizens Advisory Committee to assist the Agency. 
	(b)	The Board of Supervisors shall have the power, by ordinance, to abolish the Taxi Commission created in Section 4.133, and to transfer the powers and duties of that commission to the Agency under the direction of the Director of Transportation or his or her designee. In order to fully integrate taxi-related functions into the Agency should such a transfer occur, the Agency shall have the same exclusive authority over taxi-related functions and taxi-related fares, fees, charges, budgets, and personnel that it has over the Municipal Railway and parking and traffic fares, fees, charges, budgets, and personnel. Once adopted, Agency regulations shall thereafter supercede all previously-adopted ordinances governing motor vehicles for hire that conflict with or duplicate such regulations. 
	(c)	Any transfer of functions occurring as a result of the above provisions shall not adversely affect the status, position, compensation, or pension or retirement rights and privileges of any civil service employees who engaged in the performance of a function or duty transferred to another office, agency, or department pursuant to this measure. 
	(d)	Except as expressly provided in this Article, the Agency shall comply with all of the restrictions and requirements imposed by the ordinances of general application of the City and County, including ordinances prohibiting discrimination of any kind in employment and contracting, such as Administrative Code Chapters 12B et seq., as amended from time to time. The Agency shall be solely responsible for the administration and enforcement of such requirements. 
	(e)	The Agency may contract with existing City and County departments to carry out any of its powers and duties. Any such contract shall establish performance standards for the department providing the services to the Agency, including measurable standards for the quality, timeliness, and cost of the services provided. All City and County departments must give the highest priority to the delivery of such services to the Agency. 
	(f)	The Agency may not exercise any powers and duties of the Controller or the City Attorney and shall contract with the Controller and the City Attorney for the exercise of such powers and duties. 
(Added November 1999; amended by Proposition A, approved 11/6/2007)

If an employee organization disagrees with the Agency's designation of a particular job classification as "service-critical" pursuant to the above standards, the organization may, within seven days of the Agency's decision, request immediate arbitration. The arbitrator shall be chosen pursuant to the procedures for the selection of arbitrators contained in the memorandum of understanding of the affected employee organization. The arbitrator shall determine only whether the Agency's designation is reasonable based on the above standards. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding. 
		The Agency may designate functions other than those listed above, and the job classifications performing those additional functions, as "service-critical," subject to the consultation and arbitration provisions of this Section. In deciding a dispute over such a designation, the arbitrator shall decide whether the job functions of the designated classes relate directly to achievement of the goals and milestones adopted pursuant to Section 8A.103 and are comparable to the above categories in the extent to which they are critical to service. 
	(f)	In addition, the Agency shall, with respect to all Agency employees, succeed to the powers and duties of the Director of Human Resources under Article X to review and resolve allegations of discrimination, as defined in Article XVII, against employees or job applicants, or allegations of nepotism or other prohibited forms of favoritism. To the extent resolution of a discrimination complaint or request for accommodation involves matters or employees beyond the Agency's jurisdiction, the Agency shall coordinate with and be subject to applicable determinations of the Director of Human Resources. 
	(g)	The Agency shall be responsible for creating and, as appropriate, modifying Agency bargaining units for classifications designated by the Agency as "service-critical" and shall establish policies and procedures pursuant to Government Code sections 3507 and 3507.1 for creation and modification of such bargaining units. When the Agency creates or modifies a bargaining unit, employees in existing classifications placed in such bargaining unit shall continue to be represented by their current employee organizations. 
	(h)	The Agency may create new classifications of Agency employees. Such classifications shall be subject to the civil service provisions of the Charter unless exempted pursuant to Section 10.104, or subsection (i). 
	(i)	The Agency may create new classifications and positions in those classifications exempt from the civil service system for managerial employees in MTA bargaining units M and EM in addition to those exempt positions provided in Section 10.104; provided, however, that the total number of such exempt managerial positions within the Agency shall not exceed 2.75 percent of the Agency's total workforce, exclusive of the exempt positions provided in Section 10.104. This provision shall not be utilized to eliminate personnel holding existing permanent civil service managerial positions on November 2, 1999. 
		Persons serving in exempt managerial positions shall serve at the pleasure of the Director of Transportation. Such exempt management employees, to the extent they request placement in a bargaining unit, shall not be placed in the same bargaining units as non-exempt employees of the Agency. 
	(j)	The Civil Service Commission shall annually review both exempt and non-exempt classifications of the Agency to ensure compliance with the provisions of subsections (h) and (i). 
	(k)	Upon the expiration of labor contracts negotiated by the Department of Human Resources and approved by the Board of Supervisors, and except for retirement benefits, the wages, hours, working conditions, and benefits of the employees in classifications within the Municipal Railway designated by the Agency as "service-critical" shall be fixed by the Agency after meeting and conferring as required by the laws of the State of California and this Charter, including Sections A8.346, A8.404 and A8.409. These agreements shall utilize, and shall not alter or interfere with, the health plans established by the City's Health Service Board; provided, however, that the Agency may contribute toward defraying the cost of employees' health premiums. For any job classification that exists both as a "service-critical" classification in the Agency and elsewhere in City service, the base wage rate negotiated by the Agency for that classification shall not be less than the wage rate set in the Citywide memorandum of understanding for that classification. 
	(l)	Notwithstanding subsection (k), the Agency may, in its sole discretion, utilize the City's collective bargaining agreements with any employee organization representing less than 10 percent of the Agency's workforce. 
	(m)	In addition to the base pay established in collective bargaining agreements, agreements negotiated by the Agency relating to compensation for Agency managers and employees in classifications designated by the Agency as "service-critical" may provide incentive bonuses based upon the achievement of the service standards in Section 8A.103(c) and other standards and milestones adopted pursuant to Section 8A.103. Such agreements may also provide for additional incentives based on other standards established by the Board of Directors, including incentives to improve attendance. The Board of Directors may also establish a program under which a component of the compensation paid to the Director of Transportation and l exempt managers is based upon the achievement of service standards adopted by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding any other provision of Article 8A, all such incentive programs shall be at the sole discretion of the Agency Board of Directors, subject to any bargaining obligation imposed by state law. 
	(n)	For employees whose wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment are set by the Agency, the Agency shall exercise all powers of the City and County, the Board of Supervisors, the Mayor, and the Director of Human Resources under Sections A8.404 and A8.409. The mediation/arbitration board set forth in Section A8.409-4 shall consider the following additional factors when making a determination in any impasse proceeding involving the Agency: the interests and welfare of transit riders, residents, and other members of the public; the Agency's ability to meet the costs of the decision of the arbitration board without materially reducing service or requiring that the Agency raise fares in a manner inconsistent with Section 8A.108(b); and the Agency's ability to efficiently and effectively tailor work hours and schedules for transit system employees to the public demand for transit service. Notwithstanding the timelines described in Section A8.409-4, to be effective the beginning of the next succeeding fiscal year, all collective bargaining agreements must be submitted to the Board of Directors no later than June 15 for final adoption on or before June 30. 
	(o)	The voters find that for transit system employees whose wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment are set by the Agency, the Agency's discretion in establishing and adjusting scheduling, deployment, assignment, staffing, sign ups, and the use and number of part-time transit system personnel based upon service needs is essential to the effective, efficient, and reliable operation of the transit system. In any mediation/arbitration proceeding under Section 8.409-4 with an employee organization representing transit system employees, the employee organization shall have the burden of proving that any restrictions proposed on the Agency's ability to exercise broad discretion with respect to these matters are justified. To meet this burden, the employee organization must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the justification for such restrictions outweighs the public's interest in effective, efficient, and reliable transit service and is consistent with best practices. The mediation/arbitration board shall not treat the provisions of MOUs for transit system employees adopted prior to the effective date of this provision as precedential in establishing the terms of a successor agreement. The mediation/arbitration board's jurisdiction shall be limited to matters within the mandatory scope of bargaining under state law. 
	(p)	The voters find that unscheduled employee absences adversely affect customer service. Accordingly, not later than January 1, 2001, the agency shall create a comprehensive plan for the reduction of unscheduled absences. In addition, the Agency shall take all legally permitted steps to eliminate unexcused absences. Neither the Agency nor an arbitrator shall have authority to approve or award any memorandum of understanding or other binding agreement which restricts the authority of the Agency to administer appropriate discipline for unexcused absences. 
	(q)	In addition, the voters find that Agency service has been impaired by the existence of side-letters and reliance on "past practices" that have been treated as binding or precedential but have not been expressly authorized by the Board of Directors or the Director of Transportation, and have not been and are not subject to public scrutiny. Accordingly, for employees whose wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment are set by the Agency, no side-letter or practice within the scope of bargaining may be deemed binding or precedential by the Agency or any arbitrator unless the side-letter or practice has been approved in writing by the Director of Transportation or, where appropriate, by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Director of Transportation and appended to the MOU of the affected employee organization or organizations subject to the procedures set out in this charter. No MOU or arbitration award approved or issued after the November 2010 general election shall provide or require that work rules or past practices remain unchanged during the life of the MOU, unless the specific work rules or past practices are explicitly set forth in the MOU. All side-letters shall expire no later than the expiration date of the MOU. 
	(r)	Before adopting any tentative agreement with an employee organization covering matters within the scope of representation, the Agency shall, at a duly noticed public meeting, disclose in writing the contents of such tentative agreement, a detailed analysis of the proposed agreement, a comparison of the differences between the agreement reached and the prior agreement, an analysis of all costs for each year of the term of such agreement, and whether funds are available to cover these costs. Such tentative agreement between the Agency and employee organization shall not be approved by the Agency until 15 calendar days after the above disclosures have been made.

	(a)	There is hereby established a fund to provide a predictable, stable, and adequate level of funding for the Agency, which shall be called the Municipal Transportation Fund. The fund shall be maintained separate and apart from all other City and County funds. Monies therein shall be appropriated, expended, or used by the Agency solely and exclusively for the operation including, without limitation, capital improvements, management, supervision, maintenance, extension, and day-to-day operation of the Agency, including any division subsequently created or incorporated into the Agency and performing transportation-related functions. Monies in the Fund may not be used for any other purposes than those identified in this Section. 
	(b)	Beginning with the fiscal year 2000-2001 and in each fiscal year thereafter, there is hereby set aside to the Municipal Transportation Fund the following: 
		1.	An amount (the "Base Amount") which shall be no less than the amount of all appropriations from the General Fund, including all supplemental appropriations, for the fiscal year 1998-1999 or the fiscal year 1999-2000, whichever is higher (the "Base Year"), adjusted as provided in subsection (c), below, for (1) the Municipal Railway; and (2) all other City and County commissions, departments and agencies providing services to the Municipal Railway, including the Department of Human Resources and the Purchasing Department, for the provision of those services. The Base Amount for the Department of Parking and Traffic and the Parking Authority shall be established in the same fashion but using fiscal years 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 for the services being incorporated into the Agency. 
		2.	Subject to the limitations and exclusions in Sections 4.113, the revenues of the Municipal Railway, and, upon their incorporation into the Agency, the revenues of the Department of Parking and Traffic, and the Parking Authority; and 
		3.	All other funds received by the City and County from any source, including state and federal sources, for the support of the Agency . 
	(c)	The Base Amount shall initially be determined by the Controller. Adjustments to the Base Amount shall be made as follows:
		1.	The Base Amount shall be adjusted for each year after fiscal year 2000-2001 by the Controller based on calculations consistent from year to year, by the percentage increase or decrease in aggregate City and County discretionary revenues. In determining aggregate City and County discretionary revenues, the Controller shall only include revenues received by the City which are unrestricted and may be used at the option of the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors for any lawful City purpose. Errors in the Controller's estimate of discretionary revenues for a fiscal year shall be corrected by adjustment in the next year's estimate. 
		2.	An adjustment shall also be made for any increases in General Fund appropriations to the Agency in subsequent years to provide continuing services not provided in the Base Year, but excluding additional appropriations for one-time expenditures such as capital expenditures or litigation judgments and settlements. 
	(d)	The Treasurer shall set aside and maintain the amounts required to be set aside by this Section, together with any interest earned thereon, in the Municipal Transportation Fund, and any amounts unspent or uncommitted at the end of any fiscal year shall be carried forward, together with interest thereon, to the next fiscal year for the purposes specified in this Article. 
	(e)	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to use parking-related revenues to support public transit. To that end, the following parking-related revenues deposited in the Transportation Fund shall be used to support the capital and operating expenses arising from the Agency's transit functions: 
		1.	Revenues from parking meters, except those amounts collected from parking meters operated by the Recreation and Park Department and the Port Commission and except to the extent that they are required by law to be dedicated to other traffic regulation and control functions; 
		2.	Revenues from off-street parking facilities under the jurisdiction of the Agency (excluding facilities owned by the Parking Authority), including facilities leased to private owners and non-profit corporations, except those amounts generated from any parking on or below any land or facilities under the jurisdiction of the Recreation and Park Department and except those amounts obligated by contract executed before 1993 to pay debt service; 
		3.	Revenues from fines, forfeited bail, or penalties for parking violations, except those amounts to be credited to the courthouse construction fund as provided in Administrative Code Section 10.117-35. 
	(f)	In addition, there is hereby set aside from the general revenues of the City and County and deposited in the Transportation Fund to support the Agency's transit services an amount equivalent to 80 percent of the revenues received from the City's tax on occupation of parking spaces. Additional amounts appropriated as a result of this subsection after July 1, 2008 which were not previously available to support transit service shall be used exclusively to: 
		1.	support implementation of the transit service improvements recommended by the Transit Effectiveness Project or any subsequent system-wide route and service evaluation, with first priority given to the hiring of full time on-going staff and expansion of training for Agency employees, supervisors and managers; and 
		2.	support the creation of a Labor-Management Implementation and Service Improvement Committee consisting of the Director of Transportation and a designated representative of each union representing Agency employees. This committee shall meet quarterly to discuss implementation of this Section and ongoing system challenges.

Should the Board reject the budget, it shall make additional interim appropriations to the Agency from the Municipal Transportation Fund sufficient to permit the Agency to maintain all operations through the extended interim period until a budget is adopted. Any request for appropriation of General Fund revenues in excess of the Base Amount shall be approved, modified, or rejected under the general provisions of Article IX. 
	(d)	No later than May 1 of each odd-numbered year, the Agency shall submit any budget amendment that may be required to increase appropriations over those approved in the two year budget or as may be required by law, provided that such budget amendment shall establish a detailed plan with appropriation detail only for those anticipated revenues and expenditures exceeding those approved in the two year budget or as otherwise required by law. The Agency may submit to the Board of Supervisors such additional budget amendments or modifications during the term of the budget, including but not limited to amendments reflecting fare changes, route abandonments and revenue measures, as may be required in the discretion of the Agency. The Board of Supervisors may allow any budget amendment to take effect without any action on its part or it may reject but not modify the budget amendment by a seven-elevenths' vote taken within 30 days after its submission to the Board of Supervisors. 
	(e)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Charter or requirements of the Annual Salary Ordinance, the Controller may authorize the Agency to move funds within its budget and hire personnel without specific Controller approval so long as the Agency's periodic and verifiable projections of spending by the Agency show the Controller that the Agency's spending will be within the approved budget. However, should the projections show that the Agency spending is likely to exceed its budget, the Controller may impose appropriate controls in his or her discretion to keep the Agency within budget.

	(b)	The Agency shall base any proposed change in Municipal Railway fares on the following criteria:
		1.	The Municipal Railway's need for additional funds for operations and capital improvements and optimal maintenance of assets.
		2.	The extent to which the increase is necessary to meet the goals, objectives, and performance standards previously established by the Agency pursuant to Section 8A.103. 
		3.	The extent to which the Agency has diligently sought other sources of funding for the operations and capital improvements of the Municipal Railway. 
		4.	The need to keep Municipal Railway fares low to encourage maximum patronage.
		5.	The need to increase fares gradually over time to keep pace with inflation and avoid large fare increases after extended periods without a fare increase. 
	(c)	For purposes of this Article, a "route abandonment" shall mean the permanent termination of service along a particular line or service corridor where no reasonably comparable substitute service is offered. If the Agency proposes to abandon a route at any time other than as part of the budget process as provided in Section 8A.106, it shall first submit the proposal to the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors may, after a noticed public hearing, reject the proposed route abandonment by a seven-elevenths vote of its members taken within 30 days after the proposal is submitted by the Agency.

		1.	To ensure quality of life and economic health in San Francisco, the primary objective of the transportation system must be the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. 
		2.	Public transit, including taxis and vanpools, is an economically and environmentally sound alternative to transportation by individual automobiles. Within San Francisco, travel by public transit, by bicycle and on foot must be an attractive alternative to travel by private automobile. 
		3.	Decisions regarding the use of limited public street and sidewalk space shall encourage the use of public rights of way by pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit, and shall strive to reduce traffic and improve public health and safety. 
		4.	Transit priority improvements, such as designated transit lanes and streets and improved signalization, shall be made to expedite the movement of public transit vehicles (including taxis and vanpools) and to improve pedestrian safety. 
		5.	Pedestrian areas shall be enhanced wherever possible to improve the safety and comfort of pedestrians and to encourage travel by foot. 
		6.	Bicycling shall be promoted by encouraging safe streets for riding, convenient access to transit, bicycle lanes, and secure bicycle parking. 
		7.	Parking policies for areas well served by public transit shall be designed to encourage travel by public transit and alternative transportation. 
		8.	New transportation investment should be allocated to meet the demand for public transit generated by new public and private commercial and residential developments. 
		9.	The ability of the City and County to reduce traffic congestion depends on the adequacy of regional public transportation. The City and County shall promote the use of regional mass transit and the continued development of an integrated, reliable, regional public transportation system. 
		10.	The City and County shall encourage innovative solutions to meet public transportation needs wherever possible and where the provision of such service will not adversely affect the service provided by the Municipal Railway. 
	(b)	The City may not require or permit off-street parking spaces for any privately-owned structure or use in excess of the number that City law would have allowed for the structure or use on July 1, 2007 unless the additional spaces are approved by a four-fifths vote of the Board of Supervisors.

SEC. 8B.120.  PREAMBLE.
	The Public Utilities Commission operates the Water, Clean Water and Power Utilities of the City and County of San Francisco. Hetch Hetchy Water and Power System is an irreplaceable asset of the people of the City and County of San Francisco. The system is fundamental to the economic vitality of San Francisco and the Bay Area. The voters of the City and County of San Francisco are committed to preserving and protecting the system as well as safeguarding the extraordinary quality of the water from Yosemite and local watersheds. The voters find that the protection, maintenance and repair of the system are among their highest priorities. 
	San Francisco faces an unprecedented challenge: to restore its aging water system to ensure a reliable Bay Area water supply through the next century. Repairs must be accomplished as quickly as possible to avoid system outages, which could be caused by natural disasters such as earthquake. In planning for its future needs and those of its wholesale customers, the City must promote water conservation and responsible stewardship of its natural resources. The effectiveness of the City's Public Utilities Commission, which has jurisdiction over the system, is essential to achieving these goals. 
	In addition, San Francisco must upgrade and repair its clean water system to meet changes in state and federal water quality requirements, and to ensure reliability of the system, parts of which are outdated, aged or seismically vulnerable. The voters find that the operation of the clean water system should not unnecessarily place a disproportionate environmental burden on any community. 
	This measure is intended to enhance public confidence in the City's stewardship of public utilities by: 
	1.	Clarifying that the Public Utilities Commission has exclusive control of water, clean water and power assets owned or maintained by the City and County of San Francisco; 
	2.	Establishing rates sufficient to meet operation, maintenance and financial needs of the system based on costs and sound budgeting and auditing procedures to protect retail ratepayers and reduce interest paid on bonds and other indebtedness while ensuring public review; 
	3.	Establishing the Public Utilities Commission as an independent revenue department not subject to undue financial pressures to contribute to the City's general fund; 
	4.	Requiring the development of long term Capital, Financial and Strategic Plans to ensure that the utilities are operated efficiently in accordance with best public utility practice; 
	5.	Authorizing the Public Utilities Commission to independently enter into certain contracts;
	6.	Giving the Public Utilities Commission the ability to finance needed capital improvements through revenue bonds or other financing methods consistent with the powers of other major public utilities in California; and

		1.	If the trigger for withdrawals from the Reserve was not met in the current year, the Controller shall calculate the shortfall for the upcoming budget year by subtracting the total projected General Fund revenues for the upcoming budget year from the total projected General Fund revenues for the current year. 
		2.	If the trigger for withdrawals from the Reserve was met in the current year, the shortfall shall be calculated by subtracting the total projected General Fund revenues for the upcoming budget year from the highest of any previous year's total General Fund revenues, plus two percent for each intervening year. 
Adjustments 
	(g)	If the City made appropriations from the Reserve in the current year and in the immediately preceding budget year pursuant to subsection (f), the City is not required to allocate any anticipated excess revenues to the Reserve or to capital and other one-time expenditures for the upcoming budget year. 
	(h)	If the Controller projects that the Consumer Price Index for the upcoming budget year shall exceed the index for the current year by more than five percent, the trigger for allocations to the Reserve as set forth in Subparagraph (b) above shall instead be the percentage of growth in the index plus two percent. If the Controller projects that the Consumer Price Index for the upcoming budget year shall be less than the index for the current year, the trigger for withdrawals from the Reserve as set forth in Subparagraph (f) above shall instead be the percentage of negative growth in the index. The Controller shall use for these purposes the San Francisco All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), or its successor, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
	(i)	If the Board of Supervisors or the voters take an action that changes the amount of total General Fund revenues in any material manner, such as reducing a tax or imposing a new fee, the revenue changes caused by that action will not be counted as part of the triggers for allocations to or withdrawals from the Reserve during the year or years in which the action is first implemented. 
	(j)	In conjunction with the year-end close of the budget, the Controller shall reconcile the revenue projections triggering any budgeted allocations to or withdrawals from the Reserve with actual revenue results, as stated in the City's independent annual audit for the years in question, and rebalance the Reserve, the capital and other one-time expenditures allocation, and the general purpose allocation accordingly. 
Withdrawals for the Benefit of the Unified School District 
	(k)	If the Controller projects that inflation-adjusted per-pupil revenues for the San Francisco Unified School District will be reduced in the upcoming budget year and the School District has noticed a significant number of layoffs, the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor may, in their discretion, appropriate funds from the Reserve to the School District to offset the costs of maintaining education during the upcoming budget year. Such appropriations may not exceed the dollar value of the total decline in inflation-adjusted per-pupil revenues for the year, or 25 percent of the Reserve balance, whichever is lower. If the triggers for withdrawals from the Reserve for the benefit of the School District were met in the current year, the decline in per-pupil revenues shall be calculated by subtracting the inflation-adjusted per-pupil revenues for the upcoming budget year from the highest of any previous year's inflation-adjusted per-pupil revenues, plus two percent for each intervening year. 
Two-Year Budget 
	(l)	The Controller shall promulgate procedures modifying the Rainy Day Reserve system, as necessary, to be consistent with the City's adoption of biennial rather than annual budgets.

	(a)	If the office of Assessor-Recorder, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Sheriff, Treasurer, or Member of the Board of Supervisors, Board of Education or Governing Board of the Community College District becomes vacant because of death, resignation, recall, permanent disability, or the inability of the respective officer to otherwise carry out the responsibilities of the office, the Mayor shall appoint an individual qualified to fill the vacancy under this Charter and state laws.

(Added November 2001)
SEC. 13.102.  INSTANT RUNOFF ELECTIONS.
	(a)	For the purposes of this section: (1) a candidate shall be deemed "continuing" if the candidate has not been eliminated; (2) a ballot shall be deemed "continuing" if it is not exhausted; and (3) a ballot shall be deemed "exhausted," and not counted in further stages of the tabulation, if all of the choices have been eliminated or there are no more choices indicated on the ballot. If a ranked-choice ballot gives equal rank to two or more candidates, the ballot shall be declared exhausted when such multiple rankings are reached. If a voter casts a ranked-choice ballot but skips a rank, the voter's vote shall be transferred to that voter's next ranked choice. 
	(b)	The Mayor, Sheriff, District Attorney, City Attorney, Treasurer, Assessor-Recorder, Public Defender, and members of the Board of Supervisors shall be elected using a ranked-choice, or "instant runoff," ballot. The ballot shall allow voters to rank a number of choices in order of preference equal to the total number of candidates for each office; provided, however, if the voting system, vote tabulation system or similar or related equipment used by the City and County cannot feasibly accommodate choices equal to the total number of candidates running for each office, then the Director of Elections may limit the number of choices a voter may rank to no fewer than three. The ballot shall in no way interfere with a voter's ability to cast a vote for a write-in candidate. 
	(c)	If a candidate receives a majority of the first choices, that candidate shall be declared elected. If no candidate receives a majority, the candidate who received the fewest first choices shall be eliminated and each vote cast for that candidate shall be transferred to the next ranked candidate on that voter's ballot. If, after this transfer of votes, any candidate has a majority of the votes from the continuing ballots, that candidate shall be declared elected. 
	(d)	If no candidate receives a majority of votes from the continuing ballots after a candidate has been eliminated and his or her votes have been transferred to the next-ranked candidate, the continuing candidate with the fewest votes from the continuing ballots shall be eliminated. All votes cast for that candidate shall be transferred to the next-ranked continuing candidate on each voter's ballot. This process of eliminating candidates and transferring their votes to the next-ranked continuing candidates shall be repeated until a candidate receives a majority of the votes from the continuing ballots. 
	(e)	If the total number of votes of the two or more candidates credited with the lowest number of votes is less than the number of votes credited to the candidate with the next highest number of votes, those candidates with the lowest number of votes shall be eliminated simultaneously and their votes transferred to the next-ranked continuing candidate on each ballot in a single counting operation.

	(i)	Ranked choice, or "instant runoff," balloting shall be used for the general municipal election in November 2002 and all subsequent elections. If the Director of Elections certifies to the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor no later than July 1, 2002 that the Department will not be ready to implement ranked-choice balloting in November 2002, then the City shall begin using ranked-choice, or "instant runoff," balloting at the November 2003 general municipal election. 
		If ranked-choice, or "instant runoff," balloting is not used in November of 2002, and no candidate for any elective office of the City and County, except the Board of Education and the Governing Board of the Community College District, receives a majority of the votes cast at an election for such office, the two candidates receiving the most votes shall qualify to have their names placed on the ballot for a runoff election held on the second Tuesday in December of 2002.

	The Director of Elections shall develop and submit for the approval of the Elections Commission an alternative transportation and security plan if an incumbent sheriff is running for election or if there is a measure on the San Francisco ballot that would have a material, financial effect on the Sheriff or the uniformed personnel of the Sheriff's department as determined by the Ethics Commission. The Director of Elections shall invite the Secretary of State to comment on any alternative transportation and security plan. The Elections Commission shall send a copy of the approved alternative transportation and security plan to the Board of Supervisors.

	(b)	The City and County shall be divided into 11 supervisorial districts as set forth in this section. Beginning with the general municipal election in 2000, and until new districts are established pursuant to this section, these districts shall be used for the election or recall of the members of the board of supervisors, and for filling any vacancy in the office of member of the board of supervisors by appointment. Once new districts are established, those districts shall be used for the same purposes. No change in the boundary or location of any district shall operate to abolish or terminate the term of office of any member of the board of supervisors prior to the expiration of the term of office for which such member was elected or appointed. 
	(c)	[See editor's note following the concluding paragraph (f) of this section.]
	(d)	Within 60 days following publication of the decennial federal census in the year 2000 and every decennial federal census after that, the Director of Elections shall report to the Board of Supervisors on whether the existing districts continue to meet the requirements of federal and state law and the criteria for drawing districts lines set in the Charter. 
		The criteria for drawing districts lines are: 
		Districts must conform to all legal requirements, including the requirement that they be equal in population. Population variations between districts should be limited to 1 percent from the statistical mean unless additional variations, limited to 5 percent of the statistical mean, are necessary to prevent dividing or diluting the voting power of minorities and/or to keep recognized neighborhoods intact; provided, however, that the redistricting provided for herein shall conform to the rule of one person, one vote, and shall reflect communities of interest within the City and County. Census data, at the census block level, as released by the United States Census Bureau, statistically adjusted by the Bureau to correct the unadjusted census counts for any measured undercount or overcount of any subset of the population according to the bureau's Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation or other sampling method, shall be used in any analysis of population requirements and application of the rule of one person one vote. In the event such adjusted census data, at the census block level, are not released by the Bureau, population data, at the census block level, adjusted by the California Department of Finance for any measured undercount or overcount maybe used. 
		If it is determined that the districts are in compliance with all legal requirements, including the requirement that they be equal in population, the current districts as drawn will be valid for the next decade.

Those members of the board of supervisors elected at the general election in 1998, and those elected at the general election in 2000 who only serve an initial two-year term, shall not be deemed to have served a full term for purposes of the term limit established in Section 2.101.

		Adjustments in the Controller's estimate of the Baseline, including any baseline changes required from increases or decreases to City revenues after budget adoption, along with adjustments to the Annual Set-Aside for a fiscal year shall be corrected by credits or adjustment to be carried forward and added to the annual City appropriation for next fiscal year and, subject to the budgetary and fiscal limitations of this Charter, shall be appropriated then or thereafter for the purposes specified in this Section. 
	(d)	Debt Authority. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Sections 9.107, 9.108, and 9.109 of this Charter, the Library Commission may request, and upon recommendation of the Mayor the Board of Supervisors may authorize, the issuance of revenue bonds or other evidences of indebtedness or the incurrence of lease financing or other obligations (the "Debt Obligations"), the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation and/or improvement of real property and/or facilities that will be operated by the Library for Library purposes and for the purchase of equipment relating to such real property and/or facilities. Such Debt Obligations shall be secured by and/or repaid from any available funds pledged or appropriated by the Board of Supervisors for such purpose, which amount may include funds in the Fund allocated under subsection (e)(3) below. Funds appropriated to pay debt service on the Debt Obligations in such fiscal year under the terms of this Section shall be set aside in an account for such use until such payment is made. 
	(e)	Spending Priorities. The Annual Set-Aside and monies carried over from prior fiscal years in the Fund shall be expended in accordance with the following priorities: 
		1.	Such allocations as are necessary for the Library Department to operate the Main Library, which includes a library for the blind, no fewer than 27 neighborhood branch libraries, and an auxiliary technical services facility, with 1211 permanent service hours per week system wide and the permanent service hours at each neighborhood branch library as set by the Library Commission as of November 6, 2007, which may be modified only as provided by subsection (f). 
		2.	Such allocations as are necessary to provide for library services and collections in all formats in order to meet the current and changing needs of San Francisco communities, as the Library Commission in its sole discretion shall approve. 
		3.	Notwithstanding the priorities set forth in this subsection, a portion of the Annual Set-Aside may be used each fiscal year to pay debt service relating to Debt Obligations issued or incurred by the City under subsection (d) above. To ensure that debt service payments do not reduce overall funding available for other Library priorities from current levels, debt service may be payable from the Annual Set-Aside in any fiscal year in an amount no greater than: 
			A.	the annual debt service that would be payable under a financing with the term and principal amount reflected in a Library Commission request for bond issuance under subsection (d) above; and 
			B.	the aggregate growth of the Annual Set-Aside amount and the Baseline amount over the base fiscal year 2006-07.
			Amounts on deposit in the Annual Set-Aside in excess of such annual debt service shall be used according to the other priorities of this subsection. 
		4.	To the extent there are unexpended funds remaining in the Fund after the requirements of paragraphs 1 through 3 have been satisfied, such funds may be used for any lawful purpose of the Library Department; provided that no such funds shall be used for debt service payments in any fiscal year in excess of the amount allowed under clause (3) above. 
	(f)	Library Service Hours. Except as provided below in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Library Commission shall maintain at least 1211 permanent service hours per week system wide and the permanent hours at any neighborhood branch Library until July 1, 2013. As of that date, the Library Commission may modify permanent service hours per week system wide and at specific neighborhood branch libraries for succeeding five-year intervals, or at shorter intervals as the Commission may adopt, and in accordance with the following procedures: 
		1.	No later than March 1, 2013, and for each service hour interval thereafter, the Library Commission shall establish a community input process, which may include an informal survey of library users and meetings with the Library Citizens Advisory Committee, Council of Neighborhood Libraries and neighborhood groups, through which citizens of the City and County of San Francisco may provide assistance to the Library Commission as it develops criteria to set system wide and branch service hours for the upcoming interval. Prior to setting service hours for the next interval, the Library Department shall conduct at least one hearing in each supervisorial district to receive and consider the public's comments about existing and potential Library service hours. The Library Commission shall ensure that at least six of these hearings, distributed geographically throughout the City, are held in the evenings or on weekends for the public's convenience. 
		2.	Following the hearings in Paragraph 1, and based on the public input, a comprehensive assessment of needs, and the anticipated adequacy of library resources, the Library Commission may, as of July 1, 2013, modify the system wide and individual neighborhood branch service hours for the next five-year interval or such shorter interval as the Library Commission may adopt. The Library Commission shall repeat this public process and set service hours at least once every five years for the duration of the Fund. 
		3.	The service hours requirement set in subsection (e)(1) and any modifications thereto made pursuant to this subsection shall be temporarily reduced by the normal operating hours for any neighborhood branch temporarily closed for construction, renovation or maintenance purposes. In such cases, the Library Department shall add temporary services elsewhere by adding temporary hours at nearby branches, providing bookmobile services, securing programming partners in the affected neighborhoods, or similar means. 
		4.	If library services at any branch or system wide are interrupted due to fire, earthquake or other emergency, the Library Department shall be relieved of these service hour requirements, provided that the Library Department shall provide service hours consistent with such exigent circumstances. 
	(g)	Unspent Funds. All unspent funds in the Fund on November 6, 2007 shall continue to be held for the use and benefit of the Library Department. These monies shall be expended to construct, maintain and operate library facilities as provided herein.

SEC. 16.110.  HOUSING TRUST FUND.
	(a)	Creation of Fund. There is hereby established a Housing Trust Fund to support creating, acquiring and rehabilitating affordable housing and promoting affordable home ownership programs in the City, as provided in this Section.
	(b)	Definitions. For purposes of this Section:
		(1)	"Affordable Housing Fee" shall mean a fee calculated by the Mayor's Office of Housing as the difference between the affordable sales price of a housing unit of a certain bedroom size and the cost of developing a comparable housing unit. The Mayor's Office of Housing shall index the fee annually based on the annual percent change in the Construction Cost Index for San Francisco as published by Engineering News-Record or a similar index selected by the Mayor's Office of Housing.
		(2)	"Area Median Income" or "AMI" shall mean the unadjusted area median income levels as calculated by the Mayor's Office of Housing using data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on an annual basis for the San Francisco area, adjusted solely for Household size, but not high housing cost area.
		(3)	"Basic On-Site Inclusionary Requirement" shall mean 12% of the units in the principal project affordable to a Household whose initial household income does not exceed 90% of Area Median Income for ownership units and 55% for rental units, or an on-site requirement with an equivalent Inclusionary Housing Cost Obligation.
		(4)	"First Responder" shall mean a City employee who responds first in cases of natural disaster or emergencies, including, but not limited to, all active uniformed, sworn members of the San francisco Police and Fire Departments.
		(5)	"General Fund Discretionary Revenues" shall mean revenues that the City receives and deposits in its treasury, that are unrestricted, and that the City may appropriate for any lawful City purpose.
		(6)	"Gross floor area" shall have the meaning in Planning Code Section 102.9, or any successor section, as amended from time to time.
		(7)	"Household" shall mean any person or persons who reside or intend to reside in the same housing unit.
		(8)	"Mayor's Office of Housing" shall mean the Mayor's Office of Housing or any successor City agency.
		(9)	"Other Affordable Housing Fees" shall mean any fee imposed on residential development by the City as a condition of a development approval related to affordable housing, which fee shall be adjusted annually by the City using an index selected by the City, or any exactions on residential development related to affordable housing imposed by the City, excluding fees imposed under Planning Code Section 415.
		(10)	"Planning Code Section 415" shall mean San Francisco Planning Code Section 415 as of July 1, 2012, together with the defined terms in Section 401 as of that same date, and any successor legislation adopted consistent with this Section 16.110. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the calculation of the applicable affordable housing fee for "buildings of over 120 feet in height" shall be as set forth in Planning Code Sections 315(a)(1)(B) & (C) and 315.6(b)(1) in Ordinance No. 101-07, Board of Supervisors File No. 061529.
		(11)	"Inclusionary Housing Cost Obligation" shall mean an obligation equal to the applicable percentage of below market rate housing units required under Planning Code Sections 415.5, 415.6 or 415.7 multiplied by the then-current Affordable Housing Fee required per unit. For purposes of calculating the cost burden of any legislative change, the Mayor's Office of Housing shall use the average citywide unit mix for projects subject to Planning Code Section 415 within the past five years as applied to a hypothetical project of 100 units. For purposes of calculating the cost burden imposed by a condition of approval for a particular project, the Mayor's Office of Housing shall use the actual unit mix and unit count proposed in the development project subject to the condition of approval.
	(c)	Funding.
		(1)	In the Fiscal Year 2013-2014 budget, the City shall appropriate to the Housing Trust Fund $20 million.
		(2)	For the next 11 fiscal years, in each of the annual budgets for Fiscal Year 2014-2015 through Fiscal Year 2024-2025, the City shall appropriate to the Housing Trust Fund an amount increasing by $2.8 million per year, until the annual appropriation required by this Section reaches $50.8 million in the Fiscal Year 2024-2025 budget.
		(3)	In the annual budgets for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 through Fiscal Year 2042-43, the City shall appropriate to the Housing Trust Fund an amount equal to the prior year's appropriation, adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in General Fund Discretionary Revenues budgeted for the year compared to the prior year's original budgeted amount of General Fund Discretionary Revenues.
		(4)	Should the City adopt a fixed two-year budget under Charter Section 9.101, the adjustment for the Housing Trust Fund appropriation for the two years of the two-year budget shall be based on the amount of General Fund Discretionary Revenues estimated for the two-year period included in the budget.
		(5)	During Fiscal Years 2025-2026 through 2042-2043, if the Controller submits a revised estimate of General Fund Discretionary Revenues for a given Fiscal Year or two-year budget period that is lower than the amount originally budgeted for that period, then the Board may, by ordinance, reduce the appropriation to the Housing Trust Fund for that budget period in an amount that does not exceed the amount proportionate to the percentage shortfall in the discretionary revenue projection.
		(6)	The Controller's method of calculating the amount of and changes in General Fund Discretionary Revenues shall be consistent from fiscal year to fiscal year and with the Controller's method for calculating those figures under Charter Sections 8A.105, 16.108, and 16.109. The Controller shall treat General Fund appropriations to the Housing Trust Fund as reductions in General Fund Discretionary Revenues when calculating other funding allocations that are tied to General Fund Discretionary Revenues, including funding allocations under Charter Sections 8A.105, 16.108, and 16.109. The Controller shall correct errors in the estimate of discretionary revenues for a fiscal year through an adjustment to the next fiscal year's estimate.
		(7)	In any year during the term of this Section, the City may, in its discretion, reduce its annual contribution to the Housing Trust Fund for that year by an amount equal to or less than 56.7% of the annual debt service required to service any SB2113 Affordable Housing Bonds issued after January 1, 2013. "SB2113 Affordable Housing Bonds" are bonds issued by the City to support the acquisition and creation of replacement affordable housing citywide using property tax increment from former Redevelopment project areas under California Health and Safety Code Section 33333.7
		(8)	The Controller shall set aside and maintain the amounts appropriated to the Housing Trust Fund under this Section, together with any interest earned thereon, and any amount unexpended or uncommitted at the end of the fiscal year shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year and, subject to the budgetary and fiscal limitations of this Charter, shall be appropriated for the purposes specified in this Section.
	(d)	Uses of the Housing Trust Fund. The City may disburse monies from the Housing Trust Fund through loans, grants or other types of payments, on terms determined by the Mayor's Office of Housing in its sole discretion. Any repayment of a loan or grant from the Fund that the City receives, or any interest from a loan from the Fund that the City receives, will be returned to the Housing Trust Fund. The City, acting through the Mayor's Office of Housing, shall disburse the monies from the Housing Trust Fund for the following eligible expenditures:
		(1)	The creation, acquisition, and rehabilitation of rental and ownership housing affordable to Households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income, including, without limitation, the acquisition of land for such purpose.
		(2)	No later than July 1, 2018, the City shall appropriate $15 million from the Housing Trust Fund to a program that provides loans to Households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income and to Households including a First Responder (subject to Area Median Income limits designated by the Mayor's Office of Housing) for use as a down payment on the purchase of a housing unit ("the Down Payment Assistance Loan Program"). As soon as is practical, the Mayor's Office of Housing shall develop and implement a manual for the Down Payment Assistance Loan Program.
		(3)	No later than July 1, 2018, the City shall appropriate up to $15 million from the Housing Trust Fund to a program that provides funds to Households earning up to 120% of Area Median Income for use as assistance to reduce the risk to current occupants of a loss of housing and/or to help current occupants make their homes safer, more accessible, more energy efficient, and more sustainable (the "Housing Stabilization Program"). As soon as is practical, the Mayor's Office of Housing shall implement and develop a manual for the Housing Stabilization Program.
		(4)	The City may use monies in the Housing Trust Fund to operate and administer the Infrastructure Grant Program as described in subsection (e). The City may not allocate to the Infrastructure Grant Program in any fiscal year an amount exceeding the greater of $2 million or 10% of the amount appropriated to the Housing Trust Fund for that fiscal year under subsection (c).

	(e)	Complete Neighborhoods Infrastructure Grant Program. After conferring with the Director of Planning, the Director of the Mayor's Office of Housing shall design and administer a Complete Neighborhoods Infrastructure Grant Program ("Infrastructure Grant Program"). The purpose of the Infrastructure Grant Program is to accelerate the build-out of the public realm infrastructure needed to support increased residential density in the City's neighborhoods. The City may use monies from the Infrastructure Grant Program only for public facilities identified in the Community Facilities District law (Cal. Govt. Code §§ 53311 et seq., as amended), and shall give priority to the use of such monies by residential development project sponsors, community-based organizations, and City departments for public realm improvements associated with proposed residential development projects.
	(f)	Bonding Authority. Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Sections 9.107, 9.108, and 9.109 of this Charter, upon recommendation of the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors may authorize the issuance, without limitation, of revenue bonds, lease financing, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness or other obligations ("Debt Obligations"), the proceeds of which are to be used for creating, acquiring, and rehabilitating rental and ownership housing affordable to Households earning up to 120% of the Area Median Income, including, without limitation, the acquisition of land for such purpose. Such Debt Obligations shall be secured by and/or repaid from any available funds pledged or appropriated by Board of Supervisors ordinance for such purpose, which amount may include funds in the Housing Trust Fund allocated under subsection (c). Debt Obligations authorized hereby shall be issued in accordance with the Mayor's Office of Housing policies, and upon the terms and conditions as the Board of Supervisors shall approve. Funds appropriated to pay debt service on the Debt Obligations in such fiscal year under the terms of this Section shall be set aside in an account for such use until such payment is made.
	(g)	On-Site Inclusionary Affordable Housing Requirements.
		(1)	Application. This subsection (g) shall not apply to: any residential projects subject to a development agreement approved by the City under California Government Code Section 65864 et seq.; any project exempt from the provisions of Section 415 et seq. under Section 415.3 as it existed on July 1, 2012; the requirements of a redevelopment plan for a redevelopment project area; or any project in which the City has a proprietary interest.
		(2)	Reduction of Current On-Site Inclusionary Affordable Housing Requirement. Beginning on January 1, 2013, the City shall reduce by 20% the on-site inclusionary housing obligation for all projects subject to the on-site Inclusionary affordable housing requirements of Planning Code Section 415 et seq., including any onsite requirements found in other sections of the Planning Code including, but not limited to, Planning Code Sections 415.6, 419, 424, 249.33, 827(b)(1) and any other Municipal Code sections that refer to Planning Code Section 415 et seq. or its predecessor, from the requirements of Section 415 and other related sections as they exist as of July 1, 2012. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the on-site inclusionary housing obligation for any project be reduced below the Basic Inclusionary Housing Requirement.
		(3)	Application to Previously Approved Projects.
			(A)	This subsection (g)(3) does not apply to projects that received a reduction in on-site inclusionary housing requirements through subsection (g)(2) above.
			(B)	Sponsors of projects that already have received their first construction document as defined in Section 107A.13.1 of the San Francisco Building Code as of January 1, 2013 may not receive a reduction in any on-site below market rate requirement applicable to the subject property under this subsection (g).
			(C)	Sponsors of projects that have not received their first construction document as defined in Section 107A.13.1 of the San Francisco Building Code by January 1, 2013 may apply once to the Planning Commission for a modification of their existing conditions of approval to reduce any on-site below market rate inclusionary requirements by 20% consistent with subsection (g)(2), or change their election so that they will provide on-site rather than off-site below market rate units or Affordable Housing Fee payments. Project sponsors seeking to amend their conditions of approval to benefit from the 20% reduction must demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the proposed reduction will enable the project to obtain financing and commence construction within a one-year time period following Planning Commission's approval of the proposed reduction. The Planning Commission shall include a condition of approval to require that the project sponsor obtain its first construction document within one year of the approval. If the project sponsor does not obtain its first construction document within one year, then the conditions of approval existing before the modification shall apply unless the Zoning Administrator, after a duly noticed hearing, determines that the project sponsor has made good faith efforts to obtain its first construction document but for reasons beyond the project sponsor's control including, but not limited to, the filing of a lawsuit or delay on the part of the City or another public entity, has been unable to obtain its first construction document. In such a case, the Zoning Administrator may extend the time once, and for up to 1 year, for obtaining the first construction document. Any further extensions of time may only be granted by the Planning Commission using the same inquiry as to whether the project sponsor has made good faith efforts to obtain its first construction document. The Planning Commission may not make modifications under this subsection (g)(3)(C) after January 1, 2016.
	(h)	Stabilizing the Cost Obligation of Future Inclusionary or Affordable Housing Requirements.

				(ii)	A project located in a redevelopment project area, an infrastructure financing district, or any other area that the City designates under State law in which property tax increment is allocated to fund affordable housing;
				(iii)	A project that, through a Special Use District or other local legislation adopted after November 6, 2012, receives (1) a 20% or greater increase in developable residential gross floor area, as measured by a change in height limits, Floor Area Ratio limits, or use, over prior zoning, or (2) a 50% or greater increase in residential densities over prior zoning. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a project sponsor seek to develop a project in accordance with zoning in place immediately before the establishment of the Special Use District, this subsection (h) shall apply;
				(iv)	An area subject to a change in zoning enacted after November 6, 2012 that affects 40 or more acres or greater and results in a significant increase in residential development potential, where the area is not also encompassed by a Special Use District adopted after November 6, 2012. The City shall adopt a standard for determining what constitutes "a significant increase in residential development potential" for these purposes as follows: There shall be a Housing Review Committee comprised of the Directors of the Mayor's Office of Housing, the Planning Department, and the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, or their successor agencies. No later than March 1, 2013, the Housing Review Committee, after at least one public hearing, shall recommend a standard to the Board of Supervisors in the form of a proposed ordinance Thereafter, the Housing Review Committee, at regular intervals determined by the Committee, shall review the standard and recommend any necessary updates or modifications to the Board. The Board of Supervisors may reject a proposed ordinance submitted by the Housing Review Committee by a majority vote. If the Board fails to reject the proposed ordinance within 60 days of receiving it from the Housing Review Committee, the proposed ordinance shall be deemed adopted. In subsequently applying the standard established in the ordinance and determining whether to increase affordable housing fees or exactions in the area subject to the change in zoning, the Board of Supervisors shall consider any analysis approved by the Controller's Office regarding the financial feasibility of development subject to the proposed fee or exaction.
				(v)	A project that receives public financing or financial incentives for affordable housing from the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee tax-exempt bond financing or other similar public source; or
				(vi)	A project that receives a density bonus for the development of affordable housing through the State Density Bonus Law or other similar State legislation;
				(vii)	A project in which the City has a proprietary interest.
		(2)	Inclusionary Housing Cost Obligation. As of January 1, 2013, the City may not adopt any new land use legislation or administrative regulation, including a Planning Code amendment, or impose any new condition of approval on the issuance of a discretionary permit, that would require an increase in the project sponsor's Inclusionary Housing Cost Obligation beyond that required as of January 1, 2013, including and incorporating the reductions effected by subsection (g).
		(3)	Other Fees Related to Affordable Housing Fee. As of January 1, 2013, the City may not adopt any new land use legislation or administrative regulation, including a Planning Code amendment, or impose any new condition of approval on the issuance of a discretionary permit, that would increase any Other Affordable Housing Fees beyond that required as of July 1, 2012.
		(4)	Remedy. Any challenge to the validity of any legislation or final administrative order or decision on the grounds that such legislation, order or decision increases the project sponsor's Inclusionary Housing Cost Obligation or imposes Other Affordable Housing Fees will be subject to the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5, respectively. Any such challenge may be brought only after a project sponsor has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and shall be subject to all applicable statutes of limitations, including without limitation those set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 and California Government Code Sections 65009 and 66499.37.

Before the adoption of such legislation, the Mayor's Office of Housing, with consultation as necessary with the Planning Department, shall implement the provisions of subsections (g) and (h) administratively and shall issue any necessary guidance.
	(j)	Disclaimer. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit or restrict the ability of the City to adopt any fees or exactions related to public benefits other than affordable housing, including, but not limited to, transit infrastructure, streetscape, public realm improvement, or child care fees.
	(k)	Term. Except as provided in subsection (l) below, this Section shall become inoperative on July 1, 2043, and after such date shall have no further force or effect and shall be repealed.
	(l)	Early Termination. At any time before January 1, 2013, the Mayor, after consulting with his or her Budget Director and the Controller, and after taking into account the City's projected revenues and expenditures in the City's financial plans, may terminate implementation of this Section by issuing a written notice to the Board of Supervisors and the Controller.

THE ARTS, MUSIC, SPORTS, AND PRE-SCHOOL FOR EVERY CHILD AMENDMENT OF 2003
SEC. 16.123-1.  PREAMBLE.
	(a)	The people of the City and County of San Francisco find and declare that:
		1.	Quality public education is highly correlated with higher earnings potential, reduced crime, lower rates of teen pregnancy and substance abuse, and greater self-esteem; 
		2.	Urban public schools have the greatest need for comprehensive educational programs-including preschool programs, arts and music programs, sports activities, and after school programs-but often have the fewest resources to provide them; 
		3.	While California once led the nation in public school spending and performance, investments have greatly declined. Despite its high cost of living, San Francisco per pupil spending ranks 34th among 43 comparable central City U.S. public school districts of similar size. As of 2001, adjusted for cost-of-living, teacher salaries for the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) ranked 99th of 100 metropolitan areas; 
		4.	SFUSD enrollment has dropped in recent years as families have left San Francisco in search of affordable neighborhoods with high-quality public schools; 
		5.	The choices businesses make about where to locate include the quality of public services the City provides, including public safety, transportation and education; 
		6.	Since 2000, the SFUSD has made strong improvements in achievement measures and financial management; and
		7.	As the economy begins to recover, now is the time to invest in our children's future, before further declines begin to erode the progress the SFUSD has made. 
	(b)	This measure may be referred to as "The Arts, Music, Sports, and Pre-School for Every Child Amendment of 2003."
(Added March 2004)
SEC. 16.123-2.  PUBLIC EDUCATION ENRICHMENT FUND.
	(a)	Creating the Fund. There shall be a Public Education Enrichment Fund. The City shall each year appropriate monies to the Public Education Enrichment Fund according to subsections (b), (c), and (d), below. In determining whether the City has met its annual obligation to the Fund, the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors may consider both direct financial support and the cash value of any in-kind support services, as described in Section 16.123-5, provided by the City to the San Francisco Unified School District and the Children and Families First Commission (hereinafter the "First Five Commission") or any successor agency, provided that at least two-thirds of the City's contribution to the Fund each year shall be comprised of direct financial support necessary to meet the requirements of Sections 16.123-3 and 16.123-4 of this measure. 
	(b)	Baseline Appropriations. The Fund shall be used exclusively to increase the aggregate City appropriations to and expenditures for the San Francisco Unified School District. To this end, the City shall not reduce the amount of such City appropriations (not including appropriations from the Fund and exclusive of expenditures mandated by state or federal law) in any of the eleven years during which funds are required to be set aside under this Section below the amount so appropriated for the fiscal year 2002-2003 ("the base year"). These baseline appropriations shall be separate from the City's annual contributions to the Public Education Enrichment Fund under subsection (c), and shall be appropriated by the City to the School District each year during the term of this measure for the same purposes and in the same relative proportions among those purposes as in the base year, as certified by the Controller. 
		The amount of the City's baseline appropriations to the School District shall be adjusted for each year after the base year by the Controller based on calculations consistent from year to year by the percentage increase or decrease in City and County discretionary General Fund revenues. In determining City and County discretionary General Fund revenues, the Controller shall only include revenues received by the City and County that are unrestricted and may be used at the option of the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors for any lawful City purpose. Errors in the Controller's estimate of discretionary revenues for a fiscal year shall be corrected by an adjustment in the next year's estimate. Using audited financial results for the prior fiscal year, the Controller shall calculate and publish the actual amount of City appropriations that would have been required under this baseline for the School District. 
	(c)	Annual Contributions to the Fund  FY 2005-2006 through FY 2009-2010. In addition to the annual baseline appropriation provided above, the City shall, for years two through six of this measure, contribute the following amounts to the Public Education Enrichment Fund: 
Fiscal Year 2005-06$ 10 millionFiscal Year 2006-07$ 20 millionFiscal Year 2007-08$ 30 millionFiscal Year 2008-09$ 45 millionFiscal Year 2009-10$ 60 million 
	(d)	Annual Contributions to the Fund-FY 2010-11 through FY 2014-15.  For Fiscal Years 2010-11 through FY 2014-15, the City's annual contribution to the Public Education Enrichment Fund shall equal its total contribution for the prior year, beginning with Fiscal Year 2009-2010, adjusted for the estimated increase or decrease in discretionary General Fund revenues for the year. 
	(e)	Audit Requirements. All disbursements from the Fund and from the baseline appropriations shall be subject to periodic audit by the Controller. The San Francisco Unified School District and the First Five Commission shall agree to such audits as a condition of receiving disbursements from the Fund. 
(Added March 2004)
SEC. 16.123-3.  ARTS, MUSIC, SPORTS, AND LIBRARY PROGRAMS.

(Added March 2004)
SEC. 16.123-4.  UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL.
	(a)	Universal Access to Preschool. It shall be the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to provide all four-year-old children who are City residents the opportunity to attend preschool, and it shall be the goal of the people in adopting this measure to do so no later than September 1, 2009. 
	(b)	Planning Process. No later than September 1, 2004, the First Five Commission, in consultation with the San Francisco Childcare Planning and Advisory Council, the San Francisco Unified School District, the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth and Their Families, and community stakeholders, shall submit to the Board of Supervisors a proposal for a universal preschool program for San Francisco. The Board of Supervisors shall approve the plan by resolution; if the Board does not approve the plan, it may refer the plan back to the First Five Commission for revision. 
		In preparing the plan, the First Five Commission shall develop universal preschool funding guidelines consistent with the Childcare Planning and Advisory Council's San Francisco Childcare Needs Assessment, including guidelines designed to meet neighborhood-specific needs, such as subsidies, new facility development, and provider support for both family childcare homes and childcare centers. Such funding guidelines also shall address the unmet need for universal preschool and childcare slots in specific City neighborhoods. 
	(c)	Annual Disbursements. Each year during the term of this measure, the City shall appropriate one-third of the money in the Public Education Enrichment Fund to the First Five Commission for universal preschool programs administered by the Commission. 
(Added March 2004)
SEC. 16.123-5.  OTHER CITY SUPPORT FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.
	(a)	In-Kind Support.

The School District may use any direct financial support provided under this Section to hire consultants to help identify possible in-kind services. The Board of Supervisors may, by ordinance, provide for continuation of this planning process during the subsequent term of the measure. 
	(c)	Annual Disbursements. Each year during the term of this measure, the City shall provide direct financial assistance from the Public Education Enrichment Fund to the San Francisco Unified School District, in an amount equal to one-third of the money in the Fund, or in-kind support services of equal value. 
	(d)	Permissible Uses. The San Francisco Unified School District may expend funds provided as direct financial support under this Section for any educational or support purpose provided under law, including, but not limited to, gifted and talented programs, magnet programs, literacy programs, dual-language immersion programs, special education, employee compensation, career and college centers at high schools, teacher mentoring or master teacher programs, or other instructional purposes. The City recognizes that in providing such programs and services, a well-run school district requires both certificated and classified staff, and urges the San Francisco Unified School District to hire both certificated and classified staff to carry out the purposes of this measure. 
	(e)	Within one year of the effective date of this measure, the School District, with the assistance of the City's Department of Public Health, Department of Human Services, and Department of Children, Youth, and Their Families, shall conduct an assessment of health, counseling, social work, and nutritional needs of pupils in the District, including problems related to asthma and other chronic diseases.

		As part of the audit function, the Controller shall review performance and cost benchmarks developed by the School District and the First Five Commission in consultation with the Controller for programs funded under this measure.

		The Board of Supervisors may, by ordinance, proportionally reduce the contribution to the Public Education Enrichment Fund and the disbursements to the First Five Commission if the State of California provides funding to the City for universal preschool, provided that such disbursements are not required to match state and/or other funding. 
	(g)	Eighteen months prior to the expiration of this measure, the Controller shall conduct a complete analysis of the outcomes of the programs funded through the Public Education Enrichment Fund.

	(a)	The people of the City and County of San Francisco find and declare that major urban school districts, such as San Francisco, serve an ethnically and economically diverse student population that requires more resources than currently provided under state guidelines. In adopting this measure, the people of San Francisco choose to provide additional City resources to complement, and not supplant, state funding for the San Francisco Unified School District. 
	(b)	Consistent with subsection (a), the people of the City and County of San Francisco specifically find that their contributions to and disbursements from the baseline appropriations and the Public Education Enrichment Fund are discretionary expenditures by the City for the direct benefit of the children of San Francisco, their families, and the community at large. In the event that the State attempts, directly or indirectly, to redistribute these expenditures to other jurisdictions or to offset or reduce State funding to the School District because of these expenditures, the City shall transfer said monies that would otherwise be distributed to the School District each year to the City's Children's Fund established in Charter Section 16.108, for the provision of substantially equivalent services and programs.

A7.204  CONTRACTORS' WORKING CONDITIONS
	Every contract for any public work or improvement to be performed at the expense of the City and County, or paid out of moneys deposited in the treasury, whether such work is to be done directly under contract awarded, or indirectly by or under subcontract, subpartnership, day labor, station work, piece work, or any other arrangement whatsoever, must provide: 
	(a)	that in the performance of the contract and all work thereunder, eight hours shall be the maximum hours of labor on any calendar day, except that hours of labor in excess of eight hours per day may be permitted when conditions so warrant upon the approval of the department head responsible for the supervision of the contract, provided that compensation for all hours worked in excess of eight hours per day conforms to the requirements of the Labor Code of the State of California and all applicable federal laws; 
	(b)	that any person performing labor thereunder shall be paid not less than the highest general prevailing rate of wages in private employment for similar work; however, the Board of Supervisors may by resolution exempt from the prevailing wage requirement any contract where the work is to be performed by a non-profit organization that provides job training and work experience for disadvantaged individuals in need of such training and experience, and either (1) has a board of directors which is appointed by the Mayor, or (2) exists primarily to design and build urban gardens, yards and play areas; 
	(c)	that any person performing labor in the execution of the contract shall be a citizen of the United States;
	(d)	that all laborers employed in the execution of any contract within the limits of the City and County shall have been residents of the City and County for a period of one year immediately preceding the date of their engagements to perform labor thereunder; provided, however, that the officer empowered to award any such contract may, upon application of the contractor, waive such residence qualifications and issue a permit specifying the extent and terms of such waiver whenever the fact be established that the required number of laborers and mechanics possessing qualifications required by the work to be done cannot be engaged to perform labor thereunder. 
	The term "public work" or "improvement," as used in this section shall, include the fabrication, manufacturing or assembling of materials in any shop, plant, manufacturing establishment or other place of employment, when the said materials are of unique or special design, or are made according to plans and specifications for the particular work or improvement and any arrangement made for the manufacturing, fabrication or assembling of such materials shall be deemed to be a contract or a subcontract subject to the provisions of this section. 
	The Board of Supervisors shall have full power and authority to enact all necessary ordinances to carry out the terms of this section and may by ordinance provide that any contract for any public work or improvement or for the purchase of materials which are to be manufactured, fabricated or assembled for any public work or improvement, a preference in price not to exceed 10 percent shall be allowed in favor of such materials as are to be manufactured, fabricated or assembled within the City and County of San Francisco as against similar materials which may be manufactured, fabricated or assembled outside thereof. When any such materials are to be fabricated, assembled or manufactured by any subcontractor or materialman for the purpose of supplying the same to any contractor bidding on or performing any contract for any public work or improvement, said sub-contractor or materialman manufacturing, fabricating, assembling or furnishing said materials manufactured, assembled or fabricated within the City and County of San Francisco shall be entitled to the same preferential as would any original contractor or materialman furnishing the same if the Board of Supervisors by ordinance so provide. When any ordinance shall so provide any officer, board or commission letting any contract may in determining the lowest responsible bidder for the doing or performing of any public work or improvement add to said bid or sub-bid an amount sufficient not exceeding 10 percent in order to give preference to materials manufactured, fabricated or assembled within the City and County of San Francisco. 
A8.329  CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLES
	Whenever a position controlled by the civil service provisions of this Charter is to be filled, the appointing officer shall make a requisition to the department of human resources for a person to fill it. Thereupon, the department shall certify to the appointing officer the names and addresses of all those persons meeting the certification rule established for that classification. The Civil Service Commission shall establish certification rules. Certification rules shall not be more restrictive than the certification of all candidates receiving the three highest scores on the list of eligibles for such positions. The appointing officer shall fill the position by the appointment of one of the persons certified. In making such certification, sex shall be disregarded except when a statute, rule of the commission or the appointing officer specifies sex; provided however, the appointing officer shall give due consideration to applicable civil service equal employment opportunity (EEO) goals so as to maximize diversity at all levels of City employment. The Mayor and the Board of Supervisors shall annually review each department's performance in meeting its civil service EEO obligations. 
	From the requisition of the appointing officer or otherwise, the department shall determine whether the position is, in character, temporary, seasonal or permanent, and shall notify the candidate in accordance therewith to the end that the candidate may have knowledge of the probable duration of employment. The department shall provide for such waiver of temporary or seasonal employment as it may deem just to candidates. 
	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this or any other provision of the Charter, an employee who has been certified from a regularly adopted eligible list to a non-permanent position in a civil service classification shall be entitled to appointment to a permanent position within that same classification before the department certifies to the appointing officer the names and addresses of persons standing higher on the list of eligibles who are not then current employees, subject to a demonstration of satisfactory job performance in the non-permanent position for a period and in the manner provided by rule of the commission. The provisions of this section as herein amended shall only be applicable to requisitions for permanent positions filled from and after January 1, 1980. 
A8.341  REMOVAL OR DISCHARGE OF PERMANENT, NON-PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES
	A.	Any person employed under the civil service provisions of this Charter, exclusive of members of the uniformed ranks of the police and fire departments as provided under Section 8.343 hereof, in a position defined by the commission as "permanent" may be removed or discharged by the appointing officer for just cause, after being provided with written notice of the charges, copies of all documentation upon which the charges are based and after an opportunity to respond to the charges before the appointing officer or his or her designee. Pending investigation of conduct involving misappropriation of public funds or property, misuse or destruction of public property, drug addiction or habitual intemperance, mistreatment of persons, immorality, acts which would constitute a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or acts which present an immediate danger to the public health and safety the appointing officer may place the accused person on unpaid administrative leave for no more than 30 days unless the investigation shall be delayed beyond such time by the act of the accused person. When the appointing officer imposes discharge or removal he or she shall, in writing, notify the person removed or discharged of the right to appeal the discharge or removal by mailing such statement to his last known address. The employee shall have thirty days from the date of mailing of the notice to file an appeal of the matter in writing with the appointing officer. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the appeal shall be conducted forthwith by a qualified and unbiased hearing officer who shall be employed under contract by the City and County and selected by procedures set forth in the rules of the civil service commission. The hearing officer shall publicly hear and determine the appeal, and may approve the discharge or removal, or exonerate, or suspend the accused. 
		If the employee is exonerated the hearing officer may, at his or her discretion, order payment of salary to the employee for the period of the discharge or removal or unpaid administrative leave, and the report of such period of discharge or removal or unpaid administrative leave shall thereupon be expunged from the record of service of such employee. 
		The civil service commission shall immediately be notified of the charges when made, of the action of the appointing officer to remove or discharge, of the appeal, and of the finding thereon. The finding of the hearing officer shall be final. 
		The civil service commission may remove or discharge an employee for any charge filed by a citizen or by any member of or authorized agent of the commission when the appointing officer neglects or refuses to take such action against the employee within 30 days of notification to the department head of the occurrence or event giving rise to the charge. Removal or discharge may be made for any cause after the employee is provided with written notice of the charges, copies of all documentation upon which the charges are based and after the employee has had the opportunity to respond to the charges before the civil service commission or its designee. The decision of the civil service commission shall be final. 
		Nothing in this section shall limit or restrict rules adopted by the commission governing dismissal of probationary employees, lay-offs or reduction in force or providing for the removal of any appointee who has abandoned his or her position as defined by civil service commission rule. 
	B.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A above, a recognized employee organization and any affected City department may agree to alternative procedures, including final and binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator jointly selected by the employee organization and the City, to deal with charges brought against individual employees, the resolution of such charges and the appropriate discipline, if any, to be imposed on the employee. Said alternative procedures shall be included in a Memorandum of Understanding between the City and the employee organization which shall be effective when ratified by the Board of Supervisors. 
A8.342  DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSIONS
	The appointing officer may, for disciplinary purposes, suspend a subordinate for a period not exceeding 30 days; and suspension shall carry with it the loss of salary for the period of suspension. The suspended employee shall be notified in writing of the reason for such suspension, and if the suspension be for more than five days the employee shall, at his request, be given a hearing by the appointing officer. The decision of the appointing officer in all cases of suspension for disciplinary purposes shall be final. 
A8.343  FINE, SUSPENSION AND DISMISSAL IN POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS
	Members of the uniformed ranks of the fire or the police department guilty of any offense or violation of the rules and regulations of their respective departments, shall be liable to be punished by reprimand, or by fine not exceeding one month's salary for any offense, or by suspension for not to exceed three months, or by dismissal, after trial and hearing by the commissioners of their respective departments; provided, however, that the chief of each respective department for disciplinary purposes may suspend such member for a period not to exceed 10 days for violation of the rules and regulations of his department. Any such member so suspended shall have the right to appeal such suspension to the fire commission or to the police commission, as the case may be, and have a trial and hearing on such suspension. Written notice of appeal must be filed within 10 days after such suspension and the hearing of said appeal must be held within 30 days after the filing of said notice of appeal. If the commission shall reverse or alter the finding of the chief, it shall order that the member affected be paid salary for the time of the suspension received or altered. In the event the chief should exercise such power of suspension, the member involved shall not be subject to any further disciplinary action for the same offense; provided, that where the Office of Citizen Complaints has sustained a complaint and recommended discipline in excess of a 10-day suspension, the Chief of Police may not exercise his or her power of suspension under this section without first meeting and conferring with the director of the Office of Citizen Complaints and affording the director an opportunity to verify and file charges with the Police Commission pursuant to Section 4.127. If the director of the Office of Citizen Complaints verifies and files charges, the Police Commission shall conduct a trial and hearing thereon, and the Chief of Police may not suspend the member pending the outcome of the Police Commission proceedings on the charges except as provided in Section A8.344. 
	Subject to the foregoing, members of the uniformed ranks of either department shall not be subject to dismissal, nor to punishment for any breach of duty or misconduct, except for cause, nor until after a fair and impartial trial before the commissioners of their respective departments, upon a verified complaint filed with such commission setting forth specifically the acts complained of, and after such reasonable notice to them as to time and place of hearings as such commission may, by rule, prescribe. The accused shall be entitled, upon hearing, to appear personally and by counsel; to have a public trial; and to secure and enforce, free of expense, the attendance of all witnesses necessary for his defense. 
(Amended November 2003)
A8.344  TEMPORARY SUSPENSION PENDING COMMISSION HEARING; EXONERATION OF CHARGES
	In the circumstances listed in Section A8.341 the chief of the police department and the chief of the fire department may temporarily suspend a member of the respective department pending a hearing before the police or fire commission on disciplinary charges against the member, and the member shall be entitled to a prompt administrative hearing to determine if he or she should remain suspended pending the outcome of the commission proceedings. If a member of the uniformed ranks of the police and fire departments is suspended by the chief of the respective department pending hearing before the police or fire commission for charges filed against him and subsequently takes a voluntary leave of absence without pay pending his trial before the commission, and, if after such trial he is exonerated of the charges filed against him, the commission shall order payment of salary to such member for the time under suspension and may, in its discretion, order payment of salary to such member for the time on voluntary leave of absence without pay, and the report of such suspension and leave of absence without pay shall thereupon be expunged from the record of service of such member. 
(Added November 2003)
A8.345  DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST STRIKING EMPLOYEES
	The people of the City and County of San Francisco hereby find that the instigation of, or participation in, strikes against said City and County by any member of the uniformed forces of the police or fire departments constitutes a serious threat to the lives, property and welfare of the citizens of said City and County and hereby declares as follows: 
	No uniformed member of the police and fire departments employed under the civil service provisions of this Charter shall instigate, participate in, or afford leadership to a strike against the City and County, or engage in any picketing activity in furtherance of such a strike. In the event of any such strike against the City and County, it shall be the duty of the appropriate appointing officer of the City and County to ascertain the identity of any officer or employee of the City and County under his jurisdiction who is in violation of the provisions of this section and to initiate dismissal proceedings against said officer or employee in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.341 of this chapter. Any citizen of the City and County may file written charges against an officer or employee in violation of the provisions of this section and the appropriate appointing officer shall receive and investigate, without delay, any such written charge, and forthwith inform said citizen of findings and action, or proposed action, thereon. 
	If the appointing officer, after a hearing, determines that the charges are supported by the evidence submitted, said appointing officer shall dismiss the employee involved and said employee shall not be reinstated or returned to City and County of San Francisco employment except as a new employee who is employed in accordance with the regular employment practices of the City and County in effect for the particular position of employment. 
	In the event any appointing officer determines that he shall be unable to meet constitutional due process requirements in providing a timely hearing to any officer or employee charged hereunder, he may, subject to the budget and fiscal provisions of the Charter, engage the services of one or more qualified hearing officers to conduct hearings hereunder. In conducting said hearings, any hearing officer shall have the same powers as granted to an appointing officer hereunder. 
	No officer, board or commission of the City and County shall have the power to grant amnesty to any person charged with a violation of any of the provisions of this section. 
	In order to bring the provisions of this section to the attention of any person who may be affected thereby, each member of the uniformed force of the police department and each member of the uniformed force of the fire department on the effective date of this section, and each person appointed to the position of Q2 police officer or the position of H2 fireman on or after the effective date of this section shall be furnished a copy of the provisions of this section and shall make under oath and file in the office of the civil service commission the following declaration: "I hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of the provisions of Section 8.345 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco and hereby declare that during the term of my employment in either the Police Department or the Fire Department of said City and County, I shall neither instigate, participate in or afford leadership to a strike against said City and County nor engage in any picketing activity in furtherance of such a strike." 
	A dismissal imposed pursuant to this section (8.345) shall not be appealable to the civil service commission. 
A8.346  DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST STRIKING EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN MEMBERS OF POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT
	The people of the City and County of San Francisco hereby find that the instigation of or participation in, strikes against said City and County by any officer or employee of said City and County constitutes a serious threat to the lives, property, and welfare of the citizens of said City and County and hereby declare as follows: 
	(a)	As used in this section the word "strike" shall mean the willful failure to report for duty, the willful absence from one's position, any concerted stoppage or slowdown of work, any concerted interruption of operations or services by employees, or the willful abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful, and proper performance of the duties of employment, for the purpose of inducing, influencing, or coercing a change in the conditions of employment; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit, impair, or affect the right of any municipal employee to express or communicate a view, grievance, complaint, or opinion on any matter related to the conditions or compensation of municipal employment or their betterment, so long as the same is not designed to and does not interfere with the full, faithful, and proper performance of the duties of employment. 
	(b)	No person holding a position by appointment or employment under the civil service provisions of this Charter, exclusive of uniformed members of the police and fire departments as provided under Section 8.345 of this Charter, which persons are hereinafter referred to as municipal employees, shall strike, nor shall any municipal employee cause, instigate, or afford leadership to a strike against the City and County of San Francisco. For the purposes of this section, any municipal employee who willfully fails to report for duty, is willfully absent from his or her position, willfully engages in a work stoppage or slowdown, willfully interrupts City operations or services, or in any way willfully abstains in whole or in part from the full, faithful, and proper performance of the duties of his or her employment because such municipal employee is "honoring" a strike by other municipal employees, shall be deemed to be on strike.

The president of the civil service commission shall serve as chairman of the special committee. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall be the duty of the special committee to dismiss in accordance with the provisions of this section any municipal employee found to be in violation of any provisions of this section. Any person may file with the special committee written charges against a municipal employee or employees in violation of any of the provisions of this section and the special committee shall receive and investigate, without undue delay, and where necessary take appropriate actions regarding any such written charge(s), and forthwith inform that person of its findings and action, or proposed action thereon.

		In addition each appointing officer shall provide to the special committee, whenever it has been convened under authority of law, any other information determined by the special committee to be necessary for the discharge of its duties. The failure of an appointing officer to discharge any of the duties imposed upon him or her by this section shall be official misconduct. 
	(f)	An employee charged by the special committee with a violation of this section shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing on the charges and of the nature of the charges against him or her. Said employee shall be given such other information as is required by due process.

		If the special committee, after a hearing, determines that the charges against the employee are supported by the preponderance of the evidence submitted, said special committee shall dismiss the employee involved and said employee shall not be reinstated or returned to City and County service except as specified in Subsection (d). A dismissal or suspension invoked pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be appealable to the civil service commission. 
	(g)	The special committee shall discharge its duties in a timely manner while preserving the due process rights of employees with the objective of obtaining immediate sanctions against striking employees.

		In the event the special committee determines that it shall be unable to comply with constitutional due process requirements that a timely hearing be provided or that it shall be unable to comply with its obligations fully and in a timely manner to investigate and hear all violations of this section, then the special committee may, subject to the budget and fiscal provisions of the Charter, engage the administrative and clerical personnel, investigators, and one or more hearing officers to conduct hearings hereunder.

A8.401  EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFITS TARGETED TO MITIGATE LAYOFFS
A8.401-1  PURPOSE
	The current fiscal crisis requires the City and County to lay off employees to balance its budget. The need for such layoffs is expected to continue through fiscal years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. The purpose of this early retirement measure is to: (1) encourage employees in classifications identified for layoff, due to cuts in City and County services or functions, to take early retirement, (2) minimize the effects of layoffs on employees already laid off from these classifications by increasing the possibility of return from holdover lists, (3) achieve good labor relations by extending the benefits to eligible employees who were laid off after March 1, 2003, but before the date this measure was enacted, (4) limit early retirement benefits to employees in classifications identified for layoffs, (5) provide for certification by the Controller that the number of employees selected for early retirement benefits in each classification shall not exceed the number of employees separated due to layoff, and (6) provide for participation by the School District and the Community College District.

			The Director shall determine seniority at the time of notification using the Civil Service Commission rules on layoff. A current employee who has not received notice that he or she will be separated from employment due to layoff shall be eligible for early retirement benefits only if his or her retirement would result in the retention or return to employment of an employee who has received notice of separation or been separated from employment due to layoff. 
		2.	Exempt and provisional employees.
			Exempt and provisional employees, employed under Charter Sections 10.104 or 10.105, shall be eligible for early retirement benefits only if they have been involuntarily separated from employment due to layoff between March 1, 2003 and June 30, 2005 from an Identified Classification.

A8.406  SALARY DEDUCTIONS
	Whenever, in the judgment of the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors, extraordinary economic conditions actually exist due to unemployment, fire, earthquake, flood or other calamity, which adversely affect the life, health and welfare of the citizens of the City and County or of any considerable portion thereof, the Board of Supervisors, by a three-fourths vote of all of its members, with the concurrence of the Mayor, shall have power as follows, to-wit: 
	(a)	To officially declare that a public emergency exists, and to fix the approximate anticipated time during which said emergency shall continue, provided that no such emergency shall be anticipated to continue beyond the end of the fiscal year during which the same is declared, unless such emergency be declared subsequent to the first day of January of said year, in which event the said emergency may be anticipated to continue until the end of the next succeeding fiscal year. 
	(b)	To provide that while said emergency as declared shall continue to exist there shall be deducted from the gross salaries and compensations, exclusive of pension and retirement allowances, of each officer and employee of the City and County of San Francisco, including officers and employees of the board of education, not more than the respective amounts hereinafter set forth. Said deductions shall be made on the basis of the salary and compensation rate of said several officers and employees which were in effect during the calendar month immediately preceding the month during which said emergency was declared and not reduced by this section. 
		If said salary and compensation deductions are not reflected in the annual budget and appropriation ordinances, as set forth in Subsection (c) of this section, the amount of said deductions shall be used for the purpose of meeting or alleviating the emergency which has been declared, or to balance any deficiency existing in the general funds of the City arising by reason of the delinquency in the payment of taxes or other revenue as compared with the anticipated revenues over the same period. Provided that where salaries or compensations are paid out of bond funds, utility funds, or other trust funds, which are not provided from the revenues of the City, all deductions made shall revert to the respective funds from which said salaries or compensations are paid. 
		The maximum deductions from the salary or compensation of each officer or employee heretofore referred to shall be as follows, to-wit: 
		(1)	From the salaries or compensation of officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed $100 per month and do not exceed $120 per month, three percent of the amount of the gross monthly earnings of each of said officers or employees. 
		(2)	From the salaries or compensations of officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed the sum of $120 per month and do not exceed the sum of $150 per month, seven percent of the gross monthly earnings of each of said officers or employees. 
		(3)	From the salaries or compensations of officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed the sum of $150 per month, and do not exceed the sum of $185 per month, 10 percent of the gross monthly earnings of each of said officers or employees. 
		(4)	From the salaries or compensations of all officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed the sum of $185 per month, and do not exceed the sum of $275 per month, 12½ percent of the gross monthly earnings of each of said officers or employees. 
		(5)	From the salaries or compensations of all officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed the sum of $275 per month, and do not exceed the sum of $600 per month, 15 percent of the gross monthly earnings of said officers or employees. 
		(6)	From the salaries or compensations of all officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed the sum of $600 per month, and do not exceed the sum of $834 per month, 18 percent of the gross monthly earnings of each of said officers or employees. 
		(7)	From the salaries or compensations of all officers or employees whose gross earnings exceed the sum of $834 per month, 20 percent of the gross monthly earnings of each of said officers or employees. 
		(8)	Provided, however, that no more than 5-1/2 percent of the gross monthly earnings of per diem employees whose compensations are fixed on the basis of a five-day week shall be deducted from the salaries or earnings of any such employee. 
		Said deductions shall be made from said earnings or compensations in monthly or semi-monthly installments according to the time at which said salaries or compensations are paid; provided that where the earnings of any officer or employee are on an hourly or per diem basis deductions based on his total earnings for the month shall be deducted from the installment of said earnings paid for the last half of the month. 
	(c)	Should any such emergency declared as herein provided be anticipated to continue into the next fiscal year following the one during which said emergency has been declared, the controller and the Mayor in preparing or submitting their respective annual budget estimates shall base and estimate the net salaries and compensations to be paid at amounts not to exceed the said salaries and compensations as reduced by the above-mentioned percentages on the above-mentioned salary and compensation rates, and the annual appropriation and salary ordinance shall fix said net salaries and compensation accordingly. When any emergency is declared after the annual budget is prepared or adopted, or after the annual appropriation or salary ordinances are enacted, and before the annual tax rate is fixed as provided by law, said budget and said appropriation and salary ordinances may be revised or reenacted, so that the deductions herein authorized to be made may be reflected in the amount of the tax levy. 
	(d)	All of such deductions, whether made after the passing of the annual budget appropriation and salary ordinance or included therein, shall be deemed as temporary deductions from the salaries and compensations of said officers and employees, and shall be continued only during the anticipated period for which said emergency has been declared. 
	(e)	In making the deductions herein provided for, the value of board, room and laundry or other maintenance furnished by the City and County to any officer or employee, when the same is made a part of his compensation by the civil service commission, shall be added to the monetary salary or compensation paid to said employee, and the amount of deductions from said salary or compensation shall be based on said monetary salary plus the value of said board, room and laundry or other maintenance, provided that no deduction shall be made for quarters furnished to any officer or member of the fire department. 
	(f)	During the period that any emergency shall exist after being so determined as hereinbefore provided, the controller, with the approval of the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors, may reallocate any unencumbered balance, or any part thereof, to the credit of any department or office exclusive of monies or appropriations made or required to be made to any bond, bond interest, bond redemption, pension, utility, or trust fund, so that the same shall be available to meet the necessities of said emergency, irrespective as to whether the amount allocated to said department or office is fixed by this Charter or is the result of a tax provided by said Charter to be levied for said department. Should the period during which said emergency is anticipated to exist extend beyond the end of the fiscal year in which the same was declared to exist, the Mayor, with the approval of the Board of Supervisors, may reduce the amount of any mandatory appropriation provided to be allocated to any office or department; or may reduce the amount of any tax provided by the Charter to be levied for the support or maintenance of any department or office. Provided that no such deduction in appropriation, provided by this Charter to be made to any department, or in the reallocation of funds, or reduction in the amount of said tax otherwise provided to be levied to produce funds for any department, shall be greater than is necessary to reflect the deductions in salaries provided in the section to be made by reason of said emergency. 
		The provisions of this section shall have precedence over conflicting provisions of this Charter, but nothing herein contained shall adversely affect the rights of the officers and employees as set forth in Section 8.400 (h) of the Charter, during the period when no public emergency exists. Contributions by the City and County and by members of the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System to, and benefits, pension payments and allowances under said Retirement System, shall be calculated on the basis of gross salaries and compensations of such members in the same manner and amounts as if no deductions from said gross salaries and compensations were made under this section. 
		Should any emergency be declared pursuant to the provisions of this section, which, in the judgment of the Board of Supervisors, will necessitate deductions from the salaries of the officers and employees of the City and County, over and above the amounts herein provided for, the Board of Supervisors by unanimous vote of all of its members, and with the approval of the Mayor may authorize a further deduction from the salaries and compensations of any of said officers and employees by increasing the maximum deductions in this section provided for, up to and including an amount not to exceed 25 percent of said respective salaries or compensations as the same existed before any deduction by authority of this section. 
A8.409  DECLARATION OF POLICY
	It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City and County of San Francisco that strikes by City employees are not in the public interest and that, in accordance with Government Code Section 3507(e), a method should be adopted for peacefully and equitably resolving disputes. It is the further purpose and policy of the City and County of San Francisco that the procedures herein adopted, except as otherwise provided herein, shall supersede and displace all other formulae, procedures and provisions relating to wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment found in this Charter, in the ordinances and resolutions of the City and County of San Francisco, or in the rules, regulations or actions of boards or commissions of the City and County of San Francisco. 
	If any officer or employee covered by this part engages in a strike as defined by section A8.346(a) of this Charter against the City and County of San Francisco, said employee shall be dismissed from his or her employment pursuant to Charter section A8.346. 
	In accordance with applicable state law, nothing herein shall be construed to restrict any legal City rights concerning direction of its work force, or consideration of the merits, necessity, or organization of any service or activity provided by the City. The City shall also have the right to determine the mission of its constituent departments, officers, boards and commissions; set standards of services to be offered to the public; and exercise control and discretion over the City's organization and operations. The City may also relieve City employees from duty due to lack of work or funds, and may determine the methods, means and personnel by which the City's operations are to be conducted. 
	However, the exercise of such rights does not preclude employees from utilizing the grievance procedure to process grievances regarding the practical consequences of any such actions on wages, hours, benefits or other terms and conditions of employment whenever memoranda of understanding providing a grievance procedure are in full force and effect. 
	It is the declared intent of the voters that the state statutes referenced in this part be those in effect on the effective date of this part. 
(Amended March 2004)
A8.409-1  EMPLOYEES COVERED
	These Sections A8.409 through A8.409-6, inclusive, shall apply to all miscellaneous officers and employees except as set forth in Section A8.590-1 et seq. and including employees of San Francisco Unified School District and San Francisco Community College District to the extent authorized by state law. The provisions of Charter sections A8.400(h), A8.401-1, and A8.407 are hereby repealed and shall be of no further force and effect. Employee organizations representing employees in classifications covered by section A8.403 and A8.404 of this Charter may elect to include those classifications within the coverage of this part as a separate bargaining unit, provided however, that the election shall not become effective without the written approval of the Mayor and Board of Supervisors. The election shall be irrevocable and such employees shall not thereafter be subject to the provisions of section A8.403 and A8.404. 
	Employees in classifications not represented by a recognized employee organization shall be entitled to represent themselves with the City and County over wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment to the extent required by state law and shall not be subject to the arbitration provisions of Section A8.409-4 of this Charter. The Mayor annually shall propose all forms of compensation for unrepresented employees including salaries, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment subject to approval or disapproval of the Board of Supervisors. Consistent with other provisions of this Charter, the civil service commission may adopt rules and procedures relating to said unrepresented employees. 
	Except as otherwise provided by this Charter the Civil Service Commission shall set the wages and benefits of all elected officials of the City and County of San Francisco as follows: The Commission shall conduct a salary survey of the offices of chief executive officer, county counsel, district attorney, public defender, assessor-recorder, treasurer, and sheriff, in the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo, and Santa Clara. The Commission shall then average the salaries for each of those offices to determine respectively the base five-year salaries for the Mayor, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Assessor-Recorder, Treasurer, and Sheriff. 
	If any of the aforementioned counties do not have an office of public defender, that county shall be omitted from the salary survey for purposes of determining the base five-year salary of the Public Defender. Among the aforementioned counties, any freestanding county assessor's office or any county office in which the assessor's function is combined with other county functions, shall be deemed comparable to the office of Assessor-Recorder for purposes of determining the base five-year salary of the Assessor-Recorder. If any of the aforementioned counties do not have a comparable county office of treasurer, the county office whose functions most closely resemble the Treasurer's functions in San Francisco shall be deemed comparable to the office of Treasurer for purposes of determining the base five-year salary of the Treasurer. 
	The initial base five-year salary determination for the respective salaries of the Mayor, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Assessor-Recorder, Treasurer, and Sheriff shall apply to the period from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2012. Subsequent base five-year salary determinations for those offices shall apply to subsequent five-year periods, for example, July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2017. 
	For the second, third, fourth, and fifth years of the period for which any base five-year salary has been set, the Commission shall annually adjust the respective salaries of the Mayor, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Assessor-Recorder, Treasurer, and Sheriff, to account for upward annual movement in the Consumer Price Index during the prior calendar year; provided, that whenever the upward movement in the Consumer Price Index during the prior calendar year exceeds 5%, the cost-of-living adjustment shall not be the actual increase in the Consumer Price Index for the prior calendar year but instead shall be 5%. The annual cost-of-living adjustment shall take effect July 1 of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years of the period for which the base five-year salary has been set. 
	Except as noted below, in setting the initial and subsequent base five-year salary determinations for the offices of Mayor, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Assessor-Recorder, Treasurer, and Sheriff, the Commission may not reduce the respective salaries of any of those offices. If implementation of the process for setting the base five-year salary would otherwise result in a salary reduction for any of those offices, the base five-year salary for the affected office or offices shall be the existing salary for the office. 
	If the City and County of San Francisco and employee organizations agree to amend the compensation provisions of existing memoranda of understanding to reduce costs, the Commission shall review and amend the respective salaries of the Mayor, City Attorney, District Attorney, Public Defender, Assessor-Recorder, Treasurer, and Sheriff as necessary to achieve comparable cost savings in the affected fiscal year or years. 
	The Commission shall annually set the benefits of elected officials, to take effect July 1 of each year. Benefits of elected officials may equal but may not exceed those benefits provided to any classification of miscellaneous officers and employees as of July 1 of each year, except, after January 7, 2012, the City and County shall not pay the required employee contributions of said officials into the San Francisco Employees' Retirement System trust fund or into the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund.. 
	In addition, subject to the approval or disapproval of the Board of Supervisors, the Mayor may create, for employees designated as management, a management compensation package that recognizes and provides incentives for outstanding managerial performance contributing to increased productivity and efficiency in the work force. In formulating such a package, the Mayor shall take into account data developed in conjunction with the civil service commission regarding the terms of executive compensation in other public and private jurisdictions.

	Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.407 of this Charter, from January 3, 1992 through March 31, 1992, in return for acceptance of a wage freeze for fiscal year 1991-1992, all recognized employee organizations representing classifications electing to remain within the coverage of Charter sections 8.401 and 8.407 may, on a one time only basis, elect to bargain for no more than two additional paid training or furlough days per year to be effective only in fiscal years 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95, and a dental plan, in recognition of the wage freeze for 1991-92. Such bargaining shall not be subject to the impasse procedures provided herein or any other provision of the Charter, ordinance, or state law. 
A8.409-3  OBLIGATION TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH
	Notwithstanding any other ordinances, rules or regulations of the City and County of San Francisco and its departments, boards and commissions, the City and County of San Francisco, through its duly authorized representatives, and recognized employee organizations representing classifications of employees covered by this part shall have the mutual obligation to bargain in good faith on all matters within the scope of representation as defined by Government code section 3504, relating to the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of City and County employment, including the establishment of procedures for the resolution of grievances concerning the interpretation or application of any agreement, and including agreements to provide binding arbitration of discipline and discharge; provided, however that, except insofar as they affect compensation, those matters within the jurisdiction of the civil service commission which establish, implement and regulate the civil service merit system shall not be subject to bargaining under this part: the authority, purpose, definitions, administration and organization of the merit system and the civil service commission; policies, procedures and funding of the operations of the civil service commission and its staff; the establishment and maintenance of a classification plan including the classification and reclassification of positions and the allocation and reallocation of positions to the various classifications; status rights; the establishment of standards, procedures and qualifications for employment, recruitment, application, examination, selection, certification and appointment; the establishment, administration and duration of eligible lists; probationary status and the administration of probationary periods, except duration; pre-employment and fitness for duty medical examinations except for the conditions under which referrals for fitness for duty examinations will be made, and the imposition of new requirements; the designation of positions as exempt, temporary, limited tenure, part-time, seasonal or permanent; resignation with satisfactory service and reappointment; exempt entry level appointment of the handicapped; approval of payrolls; and conflict of interest. As to these matters, the Civil Service Commission shall continue to be required to meet and confer pursuant to state law. 
	Unless and until agreement is reached through bargaining between authorized representatives of the City and County of San Francisco and authorized representatives of recognized employee organizations for the employee classifications covered by this part, or a determination is made through the procedure set forth in section A8.409-4 hereinafter provided, no existing wages, written terms or conditions of employment, fringe benefits, or long-standing past practices for said employees shall be altered, eliminated or changed except in cases of emergency. This paragraph shall be effective only until the approval of the first memorandum of understanding with a covered employee organization or six months from the effective date of this part whichever occurs sooner. 
	During the term of an MOU, disputes regarding changes in wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment shall not be subject to the impasse procedures provided in this part, but may be subject to grievance arbitration. 
	No bargaining unit may be included in more than one memorandum of understanding with the City and County of San Francisco. Consistent with Charter sections 3.100-2 and 3.103 and subject to the prior written approval of the Human Resources Director which shall not be unreasonably withheld, appointing officers shall have the authority to negotiate agreements with recognized employee representatives. Appointing officers shall consult and coordinate such negotiations with the Human Resources Director. Such memoranda of understanding shall be restricted to non-economic items within the jurisdiction of the department appointing officer which do not conflict with a City-wide memorandum of understanding. Such memoranda of understanding shall come into full force and effect only upon approval by the Mayor and thereafter by a majority vote of the Board of Supervisors or other appropriate governing body. Upon such approval, departmental memoranda of understanding shall be attached as appendices to the employee organization's City-wide memorandum of understanding as negotiated under this part. No memorandum of understanding negotiated pursuant to this paragraph during the term of a City-wide memorandum of understanding shall be subject to the arbitration provisions of this part until re-negotiation of the employee organization's City-wide memorandum of understanding. 
	Agreements reached pursuant to this part by the authorized representatives for the City and County of San Francisco, on behalf of its departments, boards and commissions, and the authorized representatives of recognized employee organizations, once adopted by ordinance of the Board of Supervisors, shall be binding on the City and County of San Francisco, and on its departments, boards, commissions, officers and employees and on the recognized employee organizations and their successors, and all employees in classifications they represent. Except as specifically set forth in this part, said agreements shall supersede any and all other conflicting procedures, provisions and formulae contained in this Charter, in the ordinances of the Board of Supervisors, or in the rules or regulations of the City and County of San Francisco, relating to wages, hours, or other terms and conditions of employment. 
(Amended March 2004)
A8.409-4  IMPASSE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES
	(a)	Subject to Section A8.409-4(g), disputes pertaining to wages, hours, benefits or other terms and conditions of employment which remain unresolved after good faith bargaining between the City and County of San Francisco, on behalf of its departments, boards and commissions, and a recognized employee organization representing classifications of employees covered under this part shall be submitted to a three-member Mediation/Arbitration Board ("the Board") upon the declaration of an impasse either by the authorized representative of the City and County of San Francisco or by the authorized representative of the recognized employee organization involved in the dispute; provided, however, that the arbitration procedures set forth in this part shall not be available to any employee organization that engages in a strike unless the parties mutually agree to engage in arbitration under this Section. Should any employee organization engage in a strike either during or after the completion of negotiations and impasse procedures, the arbitration procedure shall cease immediately and no further impasse resolution procedures shall be required. 
	(b)	Not later than January 20 of any year in which bargaining on an MOU takes place, representatives designated by the City and County of San Francisco and representatives of the recognized employee organization involved in bargaining pursuant to this part shall each select and appoint one person to the Board. The third member of the Board shall be selected by agreement between the City and County of San Francisco and the recognized employee organization, and shall serve as the neutral chairperson of the Board. 
		In the event that the City and County of San Francisco and the recognized employee organization involved in bargaining cannot agree upon the selection of the chairperson within ten (10) days after the selection of the City and County and employee organization members of the Board, either party may then request the American Arbitration Association or California State Mediation Service to provide a list of the seven (7) persons who are qualified and experienced as labor interest arbitrators. If the City and County and the employee organization cannot agree within three (3) days after receipt of such list on one of the seven (7) persons to act as the chairperson, they shall randomly determine which party strikes first, and shall alternately strike names from the list of nominees until one name remains and that person shall then become the chairperson of the Board. 
	(c)	Any proceeding convened pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in conformance with, subject to, and governed by Title 9 of Part 3 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Board may hold public hearings, receive evidence from the parties and, at the request of either party, cause a transcript of the proceedings to be prepared. The Board, in the exercise of its discretion, may meet privately with the parties to mediate or mediate/arbitrate the dispute. The Board may also adopt other procedures designed to encourage an agreement between the parties, expedite the arbitration hearing process, or reduce the cost of the arbitration process. 
	(d)	In the event no agreement is reached prior to the conclusion of the arbitration hearings, the Board shall direct each of the parties to submit, within such time limit as the Board may establish, a last offer of settlement on each of the remaining issues in dispute. The Board shall decide each issue by majority vote by selecting whichever last offer of settlement on that issue it finds by a preponderance of the evidence presented during the arbitration most nearly conforms to those factors traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of public and private employment, including, but not limited to: changes in the average consumer price index for goods and services; the wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of employment of employees performing similar services; the wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of employment of other employees in the City and County of San Francisco; health and safety of employees; the financial resources of the City and County of San Francisco, including a joint report to be issued annually on the City's financial condition for the next three fiscal years from the Controller, the Mayor's budget analyst and the budget analyst for the Board of Supervisors; other demands on the City and County's resources including limitations on the amount and use of revenues and expenditures; revenue projections; the power to levy taxes and raise revenue by enhancements or other means; budgetary reserves; and the City's ability to meet the costs of the decision of the Arbitration Board. In addition, the Board shall issue written findings on each and every one of the above factors as they may be applicable to each and every issue determined in the award. Compliance with the above provisions shall be mandatory. 
	(e)	After reaching a decision, the Board shall serve by certified mail or by hand delivery a true copy of its decision to the parties. The decision and findings of the Arbitration Board shall not be publicly disclosed until ten (10) days after it is delivered to the parties. During that ten (10) day period the parties shall meet privately, attempt to resolve their differences, and by mutual agreement amend or modify the decision and findings of the Arbitration Board. At the conclusion of the ten (10) day period, which may be extended by mutual agreement between the parties, the decision and findings of the Arbitration Board, as it may be modified or amended by the parties, shall be publically disclosed for a period of fourteen (14) days after which time the decision shall be final and binding. Except as otherwise provided by this part, the arbitration decision shall supersede any and all other relevant formulae, procedures and provisions of this Charter relating to wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of employment, and it shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. However, the decision of the Board may be judicially challenged by either party. 
		Thereafter, the City and County of San Francisco, its designated officers, employees and representatives and the recognized employee organization involved in the dispute shall take whatever action necessary to carry out and effectuate the final decision. 
	(f)	The expenses of any proceedings convened pursuant to this part, including the fee for the services of the Chairperson of the Board, the costs of preparation of the transcript of the proceedings and other costs related to the conduct of the proceedings, as determined by the Board, shall be borne equally by the parties. All other expenses which the parties may incur are to be borne by the party incurring such expenses. 
	(g)	The impasse resolution procedures set forth in Section A8.409-4, or in any other provision of the Charter, ordinance or state law shall not apply to any rule, policy, procedure, order or practice which relates or pertains to the purpose, goals or requirements of a consent decree, or which is necessary to ensure compliance with Federal, State or local laws, ordinances or regulations. In the event the City acts on a matter it has determined relates to or pertains to a consent decree, or in the event the City acts to ensure compliance with Federal, State, or local laws, ordinances or regulations, and the affected employee organization disputes said determination, that determination or action shall not be subject to arbitration, but may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
	(h)	The impasse resolution procedures set forth in Section A8.409-4, or in any other section of the Charter, shall not apply to any proposal pertaining to the right to strike. 
	(i)	Charter Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-7 shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that the wages and other economic benefits and compensation of all classifications of employees covered by these sections shall be frozen for fiscal year 1995-96 at the rates in effect on June 30, 1995, except that wages and other economic benefits and compensation of all classifications of Airport Police shall be frozen for the fiscal year following expiration of the Memorandum of Understanding covering those classifications in effect on the effective date of this amendment. 
	(j)	Subject to the election provisions of Section A8.409-1, Charter Sections A8.403 and A8.404 shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that the wages and other economic benefits and compensation of all classifications of employees covered by section A8.404 shall be frozen for fiscal year 1995-96 at the rates in effect on June 30, 1995. 
	(k)	An agreement reached between the designated representatives for the City and the representatives of a recognized employee organization that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors on or before May 15, or a decision of the Arbitration/Mediation Board that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors on or before May 10, or May 15 if the parties waive the 10-day period between the Board's decision and public disclosure of the decision, shall be effective on July 1 of the same calendar year upon adoption by the Board of Supervisors. An agreement submitted to the Board of Supervisors after May 15, or a decision of the Arbitration/Mediation Board that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors after May 10, or May 15 if the parties waive the 10-day period between the Board's decision and public disclosure of the decision, shall become effective no earlier than July 1 of the next calendar year upon approval of the Board of Supervisors. But an agreement reached during the term of an existing memorandum of understanding that results in a net reduction, or results in no net increase, in the cost to the City, during the current fiscal year, of existing economic provisions in the existing memorandum of understanding may become effective at any time upon approval by the Board of Supervisors. Economic provisions include, but are not limited to, wages, premium pay rates, overtime, any employer pickup of the employees' retirement contribution, paid time off, and other compensation. 
(Amended March 2004; Amended by Proposition A, Approved 11/5/2009)
A8.409-5  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, retirement and death allowances shall continue to be set and adjusted pursuant to Chapter Five of this Article. 
	However, death benefits and survivor allowances, retirement allowances, adjustments to retirement allowances and adjustments to continuant allowances payable by the Retirement System and based on fiscal year 1991-1992 wages and salaries covered by Charter section 8.407, shall be calculated for all employees covered by Charter sections 8.401 and 8.407 based on the rates certified by the civil service commission to the Board of Supervisors as though the 1991-1992 salary standardization ordinance vetoed by the Mayor had become law. No such payment shall exceed the maximum amount permitted by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, or the maximum amount which would still permit the Retirement System to preserve its tax-qualified status under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
A8.409-6  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS RULES
	Within sixty (60) days of adoption of this amendment, the Mayor shall appoint a panel which after consultation with all parties of interest, shall review the current employee relations ordinance and make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors for such changes as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this part. 
	Such changes shall include the creation of an employee relations board. The duties of the employee relations board shall include hearing and making determinations concerning unfair labor practice charges, disputes regarding representation matters, and unit determinations. 
A8.409-7  RETIREE HEALTH CARE TRUST FUND
	Notwithstanding any other provision of Charter Sections A8.409 through A8.409-8, the provisions and operation of the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund, including employee contributions to the fund, shall be determined pursuant to Charter Sections 12.204 and A8.432, and shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures contained in Charter Section A8.409-4. Nothing in this section shall prevent the City and County of San Francisco and a recognized employee organization from agreeing to, or an arbitration panel formed pursuant to A8.409-4 from awarding, an adjustment in employee contributions into the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund that results in contributions greater than the contributions required under A8.432 for any and all City employees. In no event shall the City and County of San Francisco and a recognized employee organization agree to, or an arbitration panel formed pursuant to A8.409-4 award any, reduction in contributions below the minimum level of contributions required under A8.432.
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 6/3/2008; amended by Proposition C, Approved 11/8/2011)
A8.409-8  FY 2009-2010 ECONOMIC PROVISIONS AND FUTURE PROCEEDINGS
	Notwithstanding any other provision of Charter Sections A8.409 through A8.409-7, for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2009, and, ending on June 30, 2010, all economic provisions (including, but not limited to, wages, premium pay rates, overtime, any employer pickup of the employees' retirement contribution, paid time off, and other compensation) shall remain unchanged for miscellaneous City and County officers and employees at the levels set in place as of close of business June 30, 2009, and no new economic provisions may be added. For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30, 2010, economic provisions shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures contained in Charter Section A8.409-4. Notwithstanding any other provision of Charter Section A8.409-4, for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2010, and ending on June 30, 2011, and every year thereafter, in any mediation/arbitration proceeding under A8.409-4, the mediation/arbitration board shall recognize as wages the ongoing economic expenditures made by the City and County beginning, during and continuing beyond fiscal year 2009-2010, as a result of this Charter Amendment submitted to the voters at the June 3, 2008 election when evaluating any economic proposals contained in a last offer of settlement by either party. However, City and County contributions to the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund under Section A8.432 shall not be considered or relied on by the mediation/arbitration board as a wage or other payment to employees for the purposes of evaluating the proposals contained in the last offers of settlement of either party. Likewise, in evaluating the proposals contained in the last offers of settlement of either party, the mediation/arbitration board shall not take into account or otherwise consider or rely on any mandatory employee contributions to the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund required under Charter Sections 12.204 and A8.432. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 6/3/2008)
A8.409-9  MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEES NOT IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
	It is the intent of the voters that Officers and employees of the City and County of San Francisco who are not members of the San Francisco Employees' Retirement System negotiate cost-sharing provisions that produce comparable savings and costs to the City and County as are produced through the Charter's employee contribution rate adjustment formulae.  Notwithstanding any other provision of Charter Sections A8.409 through A8.409-8, for any officer or employee who is not a member of the Retirement System, the parties in any proceeding under Section A8.409-4 may make proposals, to the extent allowable by law, to effect this principle of equitable participation. If no agreement on this issue is reached, in deciding whichever last offer of settlement should be selected, in addition to the other factors specified by A8.409-4, the Board shall consider (i) the additional amounts such officers and employees would pay to the Retirement System, or the reduction in the rate of their employee contribution which would apply, if they were members of the Retirement System for the term of the agreement; and (ii) the cost of the City and County's contracts with the Public Employees' Retirement System of the State of California compared to the cost of providing retirement benefits for similarly situated officers and employees through the San Francisco Employees' Retirement System.
	Charter Section A8.409-9 shall be interpreted to be consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. If any words, phrases, clauses sentences, or provisions of Charter Section A8.409-9 are held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a final judgment of a court, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or provisions of Charter Sections A8.409-9. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or provisions of Charter Section A8.409-9 are held invalid as applied to any person, circumstance, employee or category of employee, such invalidity shall not affect any application of Charter Section A8.409-9 which can be given effect. Charter Section A8.409-9 shall be broadly construed to achieve its stated purpose.
(Added by Proposition C, Approved 11/8/2011)
A8.410  REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES
	Except in the discharge of routine duties, traveling and payment of expenses therefor shall be authorized only by ordinance; provided, that allowances therefor shall not exceed cost of transportation, including Pullman charges, if any, and a reasonable amount per diem for necessary expenses, which per diem shall be fixed annually by ordinance and shall be applicable to all officers and employees. 
A8.411  PAYMENT FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF EQUIPMENT
	Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.400(a) and (c) through (g), 8.401, 8.402, 8.403, 8.405(a) and 8.405(c), or any other provision of this Charter, the Board of Supervisors may provide by ordinance for the payment of the costs of replacing or repairing equipment, property, or prostheses of any uniformed officer or employee of the police department, fire department, sheriff's office or municipal railway, such as, but not confined to eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, watches, or articles of clothing necessarily worn or carried by such employee when any such items are damaged in the line of duty without fault of the employee. If the items are damaged beyond repair, the actual value of such items may be paid. The value of such items shall be determined as of the time of the damage thereto. 
	The board by a three-fourths vote of all of its members may make similar provision in relation to any other officer or employee where it finds that the damage or loss was occasioned by unusual circumstances or the occurrence of an extraordinary event. 
	The board is authorized to enact any and all ordinances necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. 
A8.420  ESTABLISHMENT OF AND MEMBERSHIP IN HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEM
	A health service system is hereby established. Said system shall be administered by the human resources department subject to the approval of the health service board. The members of the system shall consist of all permanent employees, which shall include officers of the City and County, of the San Francisco Unified School District, and of the Parking Authority of the City and County of San Francisco and such other employees as may be determined by ordinance, subject to such conditions and qualifications as the Board of Supervisors may impose, and such employees as may be determined by collective bargaining agreement. Any employee who adheres to the faith or teachings of any recognized religious sect, denomination or organization and, in accordance with its creed, tenets or principles, depends for healing upon prayers in the practice of religion shall be exempt from the system upon filing annually with the human resources department an affidavit stating such adherence and dependence and disclaiming any benefits under the system. The human resources department shall have the power to exempt any person whose compensation exceeds the amount deemed sufficient for self coverage and any person who otherwise has provided for adequate medical care. Any claim or request for exemption denied by the human resources department may be appealed to the health services board. 
A8.421  ADOPTION OF PLANS FOR RESIDENTS.
	Subject to the requirements of state law and the budgetary and fiscal provisions of the Charter, the Health Service Board is authorized by a two-thirds vote of the entire membership of the Health Service Board to adopt a plan or plans or make other provision for health or dental benefits for residents of the City and County of San Francisco. Such plan or plans shall not become effective until approved by an ordinance of the Board of Supervisors adopted by three-fourths of its members. Residents shall not by virtue of enrolling in such plan or plans become members of the Health Service System. The Health Service System Fund shall not be used to provide any benefits under this section. The Health Service Board shall adopt rules and regulations to administer this section. 
	The determinations made under this section, including but not limited to whether to adopt a plan or plans, what benefits to offer, determination of eligibility, and the fixing and allocation of the cost of any plan or plans, are within the sole discretion of the City and County and its officials. 
(Amended November 2004)
A8.422  ADOPTION OF PLANS FOR MEMBERS
	The board shall have power and it shall be its duty by a majority vote of the entire membership of the health service board to adopt a plan or plans for rendering medical care to members of the system, or for the indemnification of the cost of said care, or for obtaining and carrying insurance against such costs or for such care. 
	Such plan or plans as may be adopted, shall not become effective until approved by ordinance of the Board of Supervisors, adopted by three-fourths of its members. 
	The Board of Supervisors shall secure an actuarial report of the costs and effect of any proposed change in the benefits of the health service system or rates of contribution before enacting an ordinance or before voting to submit any proposed Charter amendment providing for such change. 
(Amended November 2004; Proposition C, Approved 11/8/2011)
A8.423  REVISION OF SCHEDULES AND COMPENSATION
	In January of each year, or at such other time consistent with the Plan Year set by the health service board, or at such other time consistent with the Plan Year set by the Health Service Board, at a public hearing, the Health Service Board shall review and determine the adequacy of medical care provided for members of the system and the adequacy of fee schedules and the compensation paid for all services rendered and it may make such revisions therein as it deems equitable but such revisions shall not become effective until approved by ordinance of the Board of Supervisors adopted by three-fourths of its members. 
	Commencing in 1973, the Health Service Board shall, prior to the second Monday in January in each year, or at such other time consistent with the Plan Year set by the Health Service Board, conduct a survey of the 10 counties in the State of California, other than the City and County of San Francisco, having the largest populations to determine the average contribution made by each such county toward the providing of health care plans, exclusive of dental care, for each employee of such county.  The Health Service Board may promulgate rules and regulations for the survey to allow for unavoidable gaps in survey data and to insure a consistent methodology from year to year. In accordance with said survey, the Health Service Board shall determine the average contribution made with respect to each employee by said 10 counties toward the health care plans provided for their employees and on or before the second Monday in January of each year, or at such other time consistent with the Plan Year set by the Health Service Board, the Health Service Board shall certify to the Board of Supervisors the amount of such average contribution. For the purposes of Section A8.428, the amount of such average contribution shall be "the average contribution." 
	The Health Service Board shall have the responsibility to obtain and disseminate information to its members with regard to plan benefits and costs thereof.  All expenses in connection with obtaining and disseminating said information, the investment of such fund or funds as may be established, including travel and transportation costs, member wellness programs, actuarial expenses and expenses incurred to reduce health care costs, shall be borne by the system from reserves in the health service fund but only upon adoption of a resolution by the Health Service Board approving such expenses.  
(Amended November 2004; Proposition C, Approved 11/8/2011)
A8.424  SPECIFICITY REQUIRED
	Each plan for medical care shall make detailed and specific provision for the benefits to be provided thereunder and for the rates of contribution required to support the plan. 
A8.425  PERSONS COVERED
	Each plan may make provision for the participation in the benefits of the system by the dependents of members, retired City and County employees, temporary City and County employees, such other dependents of deceased and retired City and County employees as the Board of Supervisors may authorize by ordinance, teachers and other employees of the San Francisco Unified School District retired under the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System and resigned employees of the City and County and resigned teachers and employees of the school district whose resignations occur after June 15, 1955, and within 30 days immediately prior to the date on which, but for their resignations, they would have become retired members of the said Retirement System, on whose relinquishment of retirement allowances as permitted by the Charter occurs after such date and resigned employees of the San Francisco Unified School District not otherwise included. A resigned employee or teacher is one whose employment has terminated other than by retirement, discharge or death or who has relinquished retirement allowances. The purpose of empowering the health service board to make provision for the participation in the benefits of the system to the aforementioned resigned teachers and employees of the San Francisco Unified School District is to enable them, subject to the health service board's exercise of its power, to participate in the benefits of the system after transferring to the State Teachers' Retirement System from the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System. The purpose of empowering the health service board to make provision for participation in the benefits of the system by the aforementioned resigned employees of the City and County and other resigned employees of San Francisco Unified School District is to permit the health service board to have power to treat them the same as it treats resigned teachers and employees of the San Francisco Unified School District. 
	As used in this section, and for the purpose of this section, the terms "City and County employees" and "employees of the City and County" shall include officers and employees of the Parking Authority of the City and County of San Francisco. 
	In addition to "the average contributions" in Subsection (b) of Section A8.428, the Board of Supervisors may provide by ordinance for additional funds from the City and County to pay the full cost of any plan for medical benefits adopted under Sections A8.422 or A8.423 for current members of the Board of Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors may also provide by ordinance for the continuation in any plan by former supervisors who agree to and do pay the full cost of such benefit. 
(Amended March 2000)

A8.500  RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
	In order to continue in force provisions already existing for retirement and death benefits for officers and employees of the City and County, the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System, hereinafter referred to as the Retirement System or the system, is hereby continued. The enactment of Sections 12.100 to 12.103 and Sections A8.500 to A8.581, inclusive, of this Charter is not intended to, and shall not in any way, alter or modify the rights, benefits, or obligations of any member or beneficiary of the Retirement System or of the City and County with respect to that system as they exist at the time this Charter becomes effective. 
	Ordinance provisions already existing with respect to the Retirement System shall continue in force until amended or revoked by the Board of Supervisors as provided in this Section. The Board of Supervisors is hereby empowered to enact, by a vote of three-fourths of its members, any and all ordinances necessary to carry into effect the provisions of Sections 12.100 to 12.103 and the Retirement System provisions of the Charter, as set forth in Appendix Sections A8.500 et. seq.; provided that the Board of Supervisors shall secure, through the Retirement Board, an actuarial report of the cost and effect of any proposed change in the benefits under the Retirement System, before enacting an ordinance or before voting to submit any proposed Charter amendment providing for such change.

A8.500-1  RECIPROCAL PENSION BENEFITS WITHIN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND WITH OTHER PUBLIC PENSION PLANS
	Subject to the provisions of Section 8.500, the Board of Supervisors shall have the power to enact ordinances to establish reciprocal agreements with the Public Employees' Retirement System and other public agencies maintaining independent Retirement Systems for the purpose of extending reciprocal benefits to members of such systems as provided by state law. The Board of Supervisors and the retirement board shall have the power to perform all acts necessary to carry out the terms and purposes of such agreements. 
	Subject to the provisions of Section 8.500, the Board of Supervisors is further empowered to enact ordinances necessary to extend reciprocal rights to members who transfer between retirement plans established by this Charter provided that service under any plan for miscellaneous members shall be used for qualification purposes only and not to calculate benefits under any retirement plan for members of the police or fire departments. With the exception of those members who transferred pursuant to Charter Sections 8.559-14 and 8.585-14, no ordinance enacted under this section shall extend reciprocal rights to any member who transferred from Charter section 8.559 or 8.585 to Charter section 8.509, 8.584, 8.586 or 8.588, before April 1, 1993. No ordinance enacted under this section shall extend reciprocal rights to any person who terminated his or her membership in the Retirement System or retired before April 1, 1993. Subject to the above, reciprocal benefits under this paragraph shall be consistent with interpretations that have been made relative to the reciprocal benefit provisions of the Public Employees' Retirement System and 1937 County Employees' Retirement Act which this paragraph is intended to implement. The reciprocal benefits under this section will be limited by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, and no reciprocal benefits will be effective if they have an adverse impact on the tax qualified status of the Retirement System under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.

	With respect to the Retirement System, domestic partnerships shall be treated exactly the same as marriages, domestic partners shall be treated exactly the same as spouses, termination of a domestic partnership shall be treated exactly the same as a dissolution of marriage and qualified surviving domestic partners shall be treated exactly the same as qualified surviving spouses, respectively. 
	(a)	As used in the retirement plans established by this Charter, the phrase "surviving wife" shall also mean and include a "surviving spouse." As used in these sections, the phrases "surviving wife" and "surviving spouse" shall also mean and include a surviving domestic partner, provided that: 
		(1)	there is no surviving spouse, and
		(2)	the member has designated his or her domestic partner as beneficiary with the Retirement System, and
		(3)	the domestic partnership is established or recognized according to those provisions of Chapter 62 of the San Francisco Administrative Code, as amended from time to time. Domestic partners who have formed their domestic partnership only by notarization of a declaration of Domestic Partnership as provided in Chapter 62 of the San Francisco Administrative Code shall not be recognized or treated as a domestic partnership for purposes under the Retirement System unless and until the domestic partnership is registered or certified. A certificate of such domestic partnership, civil union, or similar legal relationship issued by another jurisdiction in a form that is equivalent to the records that the Retirement System relies upon to verify marriages shall constitute sufficient proof of such legal relationship. 
	(b)	Beginning March 5, 2002, the requirement of filing a Certificate of Domestic Partnership with the Retirement System shall not apply to members who were retired on or before November 8, 1995 and who had filed a signed Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the County Clerk at least one full year prior to the effective date of his or her retirement; and provided further that, as to any such member who was retired on or before November 8, 1995, no adjustment to a retirement allowance and no payments to a qualified surviving domestic partner shall begin before the effective date of this amendment or before the first day of the month in which an application is made to the Retirement System, which ever occurs later. 
	(c)	A monthly allowance equal to what would other-wise be payable to a surviving spouse shall be paid to the said surviving domestic partner, until he or she dies, marries or establishes a new domestic partnership. Establishment of a domestic partnership by a surviving spouse shall be treated exactly the same as a remarriage for retirement purposes. 
	(d)	Notwithstanding subsection (c), no additional continuation allowance shall be paid after March 2, 2004 to a surviving domestic partner who is receiving a continuation allowance as the surviving spouse of another member on or before March 2, 2004. 
	(e)	No continuation allowance shall be payable under the provisions of this section approved by the electorate on March 2, 2004 to the survivor of any member or retired member who died on or before March 1, 2004. Any retirement allowance payable to a person who becomes a qualified surviving domestic partner pursuant to the provisions of this section approved by the electorate on March 2, 2004, shall not begin before April 15, 2004. 
	(f)	The domestic partner benefits under this section will be limited by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. No domestic partner benefits will be effective if they have an adverse impact on the tax qualified status of the Retirement System under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.

		In no event shall a member's retirement allowance exceed 75 percent of his or her average final compensation. 
		Before the first payment of a retirement allowance is made, a member retired under this Subsection or Subsection (c) of this Section, may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her allowance, partly in an allowance to be received by him or her throughout his life, and partly in other benefits payable after his or her death to another person or persons, provided that such election shall be subject to all the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar elections by other members of the Retirement System, including the character and amount, of such other benefits. In the calculations under this Subsection of the retirement allowance of a member having credit for service in a position in the evening schools and service in any other position, separate retirement allowances shall be calculated in the manner prescribed for each class of service, the average final compensation in each case being that for the respective class of service; provided that the aggregate retirement allowance shall be taken into account in applying the provisions of this Subsection providing for a minimum retirement allowance. Part-time service and compensation shall be reduced to full-time service and compensation in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, and when so reduced, shall be applied on full-time service and compensation in the calculations of retirement allowances. 
	(c)	Any member who becomes incapacitated for performance of duty because of disability determined by the Retirement Board to be of extended and uncertain duration, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service credited in the Retirement System in the aggregate, computed as provided in Subsection (g) hereof, shall be retired upon an allowance of one and eight-tenths percent of the average final compensation of said member, as defined in Subsection (a) hereof for each year of credited service, if such retirement allowance exceeds 40 percent of his or her average final compensation; otherwise one and eight-tenths percent of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of City-service which would be credited to him or her were such City-service to continue until attainment by him or her of age 60, but such retirement allowance shall not exceed 40 percent of such average final compensation. In the calculation under this Subsection of the retirement allowance of a member having credit for service in a position in the evening schools and service in any other position, separate retirement allowances shall be calculated, in the manner prescribed, for each class of service, the average final compensation in each case being that for the respective class of service; provided that the average final compensation upon which the minimum total retirement allowance is calculated in such case shall be based on the compensation earnable by the member in the classes of service rendered by him or her during the one year immediately preceding his or her retirement. Part-time service and compensation shall be reduced to full-time service and compensation in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, and when so reduced, shall be applied as full-time service and compensation in the calculation of retirement allowances. An application for a disability retirement may be brought before the Retirement Board on said Board's own motion, by the Executive Director of the Retirement System, by recommendation of any department head, commission or board, or by said member or his or her guardian. If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease, and he or she shall be restored to service in the position or classification he or she occupied at the time of his or her retirement. 
	(d)	No modification of benefits provided in this section shall be made because of any amounts payable to or on account of any member under workers' compensation laws of the State of California. 
	(e)	If a member shall die, before retirement,
		(1)	If no benefit is payable under subdivision (2) of this subsection (e):

			(B)	If a member sustains a traumatic bodily injury through external and violent means in the course and scope of employment and death results within 180 days of such injury, an additional insurance benefit of 12 months of compensation earnable shall be paid to the member's estate or designated beneficiary. 
		(2)	If, at the date of his or her death, he or she was qualified for service retirement by reason of service and age under the provisions of Subsection (b) of this Section, and he or she has designated as beneficiary his or her surviving spouse, who was married to him or her for at least one full year immediately prior to the date of his or her death, one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired from service on the date of his or her death, shall be paid to such surviving spouse who was his or her designated-beneficiary at the date of his or her death, until such spouse's death or remarriage, or if there be no surviving spouse, to the unmarried child or children of such member under the age of 18 years, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If, at the death of such surviving spouse, who was receiving an allowance under this Subdivision (2), there be one or more unmarried children of such member under the age of 18 years, such allowance shall continue to such child or children, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subdivision (2) is less than the benefit which was otherwise payable under Subdivision (1) of this Subsection, the amount of said benefit payable under Subdivision (1) less an amount equal to the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subdivision (2) shall be paid in lump sum as follows: 
			(A)	If the person last entitled to said allowance is the remarried surviving spouse of such member, to such spouse.
			(B)	Otherwise, to the surviving children of the member, share and share alike, or if there are no such children, to the estate of the person last entitled to said allowance. 
		The surviving spouse may elect, on a form provided by the Retirement System and filed in the office of the Retirement System before the first payment of the allowance provided herein, to receive the benefit provided in Subdivision (1) of this Subsection in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be payable under the provisions of this Subdivision. If a surviving spouse, who was entitled to make the election herein provided, shall die before or after making such election, but before receiving any payment pursuant to such election, then the legally appointed guardian of the unmarried children of the member under the age of 18 years, may make the election herein provided before benefit has been paid under this Subsection (e), for and on behalf of such children if, in his or her judgment it appears to be in their interest and advantage, and the election so made shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties in interest. 
		If any person other than such surviving spouse shall have and be paid a community property interest in any portion of any benefit provided under this Subsection (e), any allowance payable under this Subdivision (2) shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent, at the date of the member's death, of the amount of benefits paid to such other person. 
		Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
	(f)	Should any miscellaneous member cease to be employed as such a member, through any cause other than death or retirement, all of his or her contributions, with interest credited thereon, shall be refunded to him or her subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to cover similar terminations of employment and reemployment with and without redeposit of withdrawn accumulated contributions of other members of the Retirement System, provided that if such member is entitled to be credited with at least 10 years of service or if his or her accumulated contributions exceed $1,000, he or she shall have the right to elect, without right of revocation and within 90 days after said termination of service, or if the termination was by lay-off, 90 days after the Retirement Board determines the termination to be permanent, whether to allow his or her accumulated contributions to remain in the retirement fund and to receive benefits only as provided in this paragraph. Failure to make such election shall be deemed an irrevocable election to withdraw his or her accumulated contributions. A person who elects to allow his or her accumulated contributions to remain in the retirement fund shall be subject to the same age requirements as apply to other members under this Section for service retirement, but he or she shall not be subject to a minimum service requirement. Upon the qualification of such member for retirement by reason of age, he or she shall be entitled to receive a retirement allowance which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his or his accumulated contributions and an equal amount of the contributions of the City and County, plus 12/3 percent of his average final compensation for each year of service credited to him or her as rendered prior to his first membership in the Retirement System. Upon the death of such member prior to retirement, his or her contributions with interest credited thereon shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary. 
	(g)	The following time and service shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member for the purpose of determining whether such member qualifies for retirement and calculating benefits: 
		(1)	Time during which said member is a member of the Retirement System and during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a miscellaneous officer or employee. 
		(2)	Service in the fire and police departments which is not credited as service of a member under this Section shall count under this Section upon transfer of a member of either of such departments to employment entitling him or her to membership in the Retirement System under this Section, provided that the accumulated contribution standing to the credit of such member shall be adjusted by refund to the member or by payment of the member, to bring the account at the time of such transfer to the amount which would have been credited to it had the member been a miscellaneous employee throughout the period of his or her service in either such departments at the compensation he or she received in such departments. 
		(3)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in paragraphs (1) or (2) next preceding which is not deemed absence from service under the provisions of Section A8.520 of the Charter and for which such member is entitled to receive credit as service for the City and County by virtue of contributions made in accordance with the provisions of such Section. 
		(4)	Prior service determined and credited as prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for persons who are members under Section A8.507. 
		(5)	The Board of Supervisors, by ordinance enacted by a three-fourths vote of its members, may provide for the crediting as service under the Retirement System of service, other than military service, rendered as an employee of the federal government and service rendered as an employee of the State of California or any public entity or public agency in the State of California. Said ordinance shall provide that all contributions required as the result of the crediting of such service shall be made by the member and that no contributions therefor shall be required of the City and County. 
		(6)	Time during which said member was on Unpaid Parental Leave pursuant to Charter Section A8.523, and for which said member has purchased service credit in the Retirement System. 
	(h)	All payments provided under this Section shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
		(1)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation paid to a member under Section A8.509 a sum equal to 7½ percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member under Section A8.509, or shall be paid to said member or his estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections A8.509(e) and A8.509(f). The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest.
		(2)	Contributions based on time included in paragraphs (1) and (3) of Subsection (g), and deducted prior to July 1, 1947, from compensation of persons who become members under this Section, and standing with interest thereon, to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, shall continue to be credited to the individual accounts of said members, and shall be combined with and administered in the same manner as the contributions deducted after said date. 
		(3)	The total contributions, with interest thereon, made by or charged against the City and County and standing to its credit, on July 1, 1948, in the accounts of the Retirement System, on account of persons who become members under this Section, shall be applied to provide the benefits under this Section. 
		(4)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Subsection (h), to provide the benefits payable under this Section. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder, which shall be based on service rendered by each member prior to the date upon which his or her rate of contribution is determined in paragraph (1), Subsection (h), shall not be less during any fiscal year than the amount of such benefits paid during said year. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder, which shall be based on service rendered by respective members on and after the date stated in the next preceding sentence, shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total salaries paid during said year, to persons who are members under this Section, said percentage to be the ratio of the value of the effective date hereof, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid under this Section, from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, and plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said system to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective member after the date stated in the sentence next preceding, to the value at said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement, and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year, and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be made every odd-numbered year. 
			Notwithstanding the provisions of this Subdivision (4), any additional liabilities created by the amendments of this Section A8.509 contained in the proposition therefor submitted to the electorate on November 6, 1973, shall be amortized over a period of 30 years. 
		(5)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section A8.509 or this Charter, beginning on July 1, 2012, the employee contribution rate set forth in Subsection (h)(1) for each member with a base rate of pay at or above $24.00 per hour, but less than $48.00 per hour, shall be increased or decreased each fiscal year based on the employer contribution rate for that fiscal year calculated by the Retirement System's actuary as prescribed in Subsection (h)(4). The foregoing base rates of pay shall be adjusted each fiscal year by the percentage increase in the cost of living during the previous calendar year, as shown by the then current CPI-U Index, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but not to exceed three and one-half percent (3.5% ).

		When a member makes the contributions as provided herein, the same contributions shall be made by the City and County in respect to such absence that would have been made by the City and County if the member had not been absent because of such evacuation or exclusion, except that such contributions shall be determined by the employer's rate of contribution in effect when such contributions are made, and on the basis of his compensation earnable at the commencement of his absence.

	(b)	On July 1, 1997, if there are sufficient funds in this Reserve Account, each retirement allowance payable to or account of a member who was retired on or before December 31, 1979 as a member under Sections 8.507 or 8.509 or 8.584 shall be increased by a monthly amount equal to $3 for each complete year of retirement. In computing years of retirement, the Retirement System shall count completed fiscal years between the member's effective date of retirement and June 30, 1997. 
	(c)	On and after June 30, 2003, any supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment, once paid to a member, shall not be reduced thereafter. 
	(d)	On and after June 30, 2003, the Reserve Account set forth in this section shall be used to finance only the increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments for the next ensuing fiscal year as set forth in section (a). If there are insufficient funds in the Reserve Account to pay the increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments for the next ensuing fiscal year, then the increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments for that fiscal year shall not be paid. However, any excess earnings as defined in this section shall be accumulated until an amount sufficient to make one fiscal year's increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments is reached.

	(a)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section A8.526 or any other provision of the Charter to the contrary, effective January 10, 2009, each retirement allowance payable which is not subject to change when the salary rate of any member is changed shall be adjusted according to the provisions of this Section A8.526-2 and not Section A8.526. 
	(b)	(1) 	Funds necessary for the payment of any increase in allowances pursuant to this Section A8.526-2 that are payable to, or on account of, members who retired or died, shall be provided from the City's accumulated contributions held by the system on account of such members. The City's contributions shall be determined on the basis of a normal contribution rate which shall be computed as a level percentage of compensation which, when applied to the future compensation of the average new member entering the system, together with the required member contribution, will be sufficient to provide for the payment of all prospective benefits of such member. 
	(b)	(2)	Any increase in allowances payable which are not funded by the City's accumulated contributions held by the system shall be funded by contributions of members entitled to said allowances, which shall be at rates which are in addition to the rates of contribution otherwise provided by Charter or ordinance, provided that a member's rate of contribution shall not exceed one-half of one percent of his or her monthly compensation. The contributions made under this section by any member shall be credited together with regular interest thereon to his or her individual account and shall be subject to the same Charter and ordinance provisions relating to accumulated contributions of the member, including withdrawal and death benefits other than death allowances, provided, however, that upon his or her retirement or death, such accumulated contributions and interest shall not be applied to provide a part of the retirement benefits payable to him or her on the death allowance benefits payable on account of his or her death otherwise provided by Charter or ordinance, but instead shall be held, together with the accumulated contributions made by the City pursuant to this Subsection (b)(3), with interest thereon, to provide the benefits under this Section A8.526-2. 
	(b)	(3)	The rates of contribution of members and the City, as provided herein, shall be fixed by the retirement board from time to time as it determines necessary. 
	(c)	(1) 	The retirement board shall determine, prior to April 1 of each year, the percentage of increase or decrease in the cost of living during the preceding calendar year, as shown by the then current Consumer Price Index. All Items, San Francisco (1957-59=100), issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and published in the Monthly Labor Review or a successor publication. The cost of living adjustments as hereinafter provided shall be based on the percentage of such increase or decrease. 
	(c)	(2)	Notwithstanding any other Charter or ordinance provision governing the Retirement System, effective January 10, 2009, every retirement or death allowance payable to, or on account of any member who retires or dies as a member of the system or who has retired or died as such a member, except allowances subject to change when the salary rate of any member is changed, shall be increased or decreased as of July 1, 2009, and on July 1, of each succeeding year by an amount equal to the percentage, as determined in Subsection (c)(1) multiplied by the monthly allowance payable on June 30 of that calendar year. 
	(c)	(3)	The percentage of increase or decrease in each such allowance shall be the percentage which is determined by the retirement board to approximate to the nearest one percent increase or decrease in the cost of living during the preceding calendar year. 
	(c)	(4)	No such adjustment in any year shall exceed two percent of said allowance: provided, however, that no allowance shall be reduced below the amount being received by the member or the member's beneficiary on July 1, 1968, or on the effective date the member began to receive the allowance, whichever is later. 
	(d)	(1)	Commencing with the effective date of this Section A8.526-2, if the percentage of increase or decrease in the cost of living in any calendar year, as determined to the nearest one percent by the retirement board, were to exceed two percent as compared with the cost of living in the next preceding calendar year, the percentage of increase or decrease in the cost of living in excess of two percent, shall be accumulated to provide increases or decreases in the cost of living in each succeeding calendar year.

A8.526-3  SUPPLEMENTAL COST OF LIVING BENEFIT ON AND AFTER JANUARY 10, 2009
	(a)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section A8.526-1 or any other provision of this Charter to the contrary, effective January 10, 2009, all supplemental cost of living benefits adjustments payable, including retirement allowances subject to change when the salary rate of a member is changed, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of Section A8.526-3 and not Section A8.526-1. 
	(b)	(1)	On July 1, 2009 and July 1 of each succeeding year, the retirement board shall determine whether, in the previous fiscal year, there were earnings in excess of the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets. In those years when the previous year's earnings exceeded the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets, then on July 1 each retirement allowance or death allowance payable on account of a member who died, including retirement allowances subject to change when the salary rate of a member is changed, shall be increased by an amount equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the allowance as of June 30, less the amount of any cost of living adjustment provided pursuant to Section A8.526-2 and less the amount of any cost of living adjustment, payable in that fiscal year, which is the result of a change in the salary of the member. 
	(b)	(2) 	If on July 1, 2009 and July 1 of each succeeding year, the previous fiscal year's earnings exceeded the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets, but they were insufficient to increase said allowances by three and one-half percent (3.5%) as provided in Subsection (b)(1), then to the extent of excess earning, said allowances shall be increased in increments of one-half percent (.5%) up to the maximum three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the allowance as of June 30, less the amount of any cost of living adjustment provided pursuant to Section A8.526-2 and less the amount of any cost of living adjustment, payable in that fiscal year, which is the result of a change in the salary of the member. 
	(c)	When the previous fiscal year's earnings exceeded the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets but were not sufficient to fund any supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment pursuant to either Subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), the Retirement Board shall reserve the excess earnings for that year. Said reserved earnings shall accumulate only until such time that said reserved earnings, plus the next year's earnings in excess of the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets, are sufficient to fund one fiscal year's increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment, at which time the earnings in reserve shall be withdrawn and used to fund a supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment as provided in either Subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). 
	(d)	To clarify the intent of the voters when originally enacting this Section in 2008, beginning on July 1, 2012 and July 1 of each succeeding year, no supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment shall be payable unless the Retirement System was also fully funded based on the market value of the assets for the previous year.
	(e)	Any supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment, once paid to a member, shall not be reduced thereafter.
	(f)	Any Section or part of any Section in this Charter, insofar as it should conflict with the provisions of Section A8.526-3 or with any part thereof shall be superseded by the contents of Section A8.526-3. Section A8.526-3 shall be interpreted to be consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections, provisions or portions of Section A8.526-3 are held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a final judgment of a court, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections, provisions or portions of Section A8.526-3. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections, provisions or portions of Section A8.526-3 are held invalid as applied to any person, circumstance, employee or category of employee, such invalidity shall not affect any application of Section A8.526-3 which can be given effect. Section A8.526-3 shall be broadly construed to achieve its stated purposes.

A8.526-4  SUPPLEMENTAL COST OF LIVING BENEFIT FOR PERSONS HIRED ON AND AFTER JANUARY 7, 2012
	(a)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Charter, for persons who are hired on and after January 7, 2012, all supplemental cost of living benefits adjustments payable, shall be determined under the provisions of Section A8.526-4 and not Sections A8.526-1 or A8.526-3.
	(b)	(1) 	On July 1, 2012 and July 1 of each succeeding year, the Retirement Board shall determine whether, in the previous fiscal year, there were earnings in excess of the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets. In those years when the previous year's earnings exceeded the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets, and the Retirement System was fully funded based on the market value of the assets, then on July 1, each retirement allowance payable or death allowance payable on account of a member who died, shall be increased by an amount equal to three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the allowance as of June 30, less the amount of any cost of living adjustment provided pursuant to Section A8.526-2, provided there were sufficient excess earnings to provide the benefits in this Section A8.526-4.
	(b)	(2)	If on July 1, 2012 and July 1 of each succeeding year, the previous fiscal year's earnings exceeded the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets, but they were insufficient to increase said allowances by three and one-half percent (3.5%) as provided in Subsection (b)(1), then to the extent of excess earnings, said allowances shall be increased in increments of one-half percent (.5%) up to the maximum three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the allowance as of June 30, less the amount of any cost of living adjustment provided pursuant to Section A8.526-2.
	(c)	The supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment described above will not be paid in any fiscal year when there were insufficient earnings in excess of the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets. In that event, retirement allowances will revert to the level they would have been if supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments had never been made.

If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she die or remarry before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents depending upon him for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving widow otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife following the death of a member unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
A8.549  PAYMENT OF SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the police department resulting from any cause, other than injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty: 
	(a)	if his death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Sections 8.540, 8.543 or 8.546, or after retirement for service or because of disability which resulted from any cause other than any injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, three-fourths of his retirement allowance to which he would have been entitled if he had retired for service at the time of his death or three-fourths of his retirement allowance as it was at his death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife; or 
	(b)	if his death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of age 50 years, three-fourths of the retirement allowance to which he would have been entitled under section 8.546 if he had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife; or 
	(c)	if his death occurred after retirement because of disability which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, his retirement allowance as it was at his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died; or 
	(d)	if his death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.554, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section 8.547 if he had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty resulting from a cause other than bodily injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she die or remarry before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under the age of eighteen years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parent dependent upon him for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving wife otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or the onset of the illness which results in death, if he had not retired, or unless she was married to the member at least one year prior his death. 
	As used in this section and Section 8.548, "surviving wife" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving wife, in the event of death of the member after qualification for but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section 8.552 in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to her under this section. If there be no surviving wife, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there be no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. Persons heretofore or hereafter retired under other Charter sections as members of the police department at the time of retirement, shall be subject to the provisions of this section. With respect to members under Section 8.544, "qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement," or "qualified as to age and service retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section 8.544 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section 8.554. 
	The amendments of this Section 8.549 contained in the proposition herefor submitted to the electorate on November 7, 1972, are hereby declared to be retroactive and shall be applicable to members who died after October 1, 1970. 
A8.550  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES
	(a)	Every allowance based on the average monthly compensation earnable by the member during the three or 10 years prior to retirement or death, and payable for time commencing on April 1, 1952, to or on account of persons who were retired or who died prior to January 1, 1951, as members of the police department, shall be adjusted to the amount it would be if it had been based on the monthly compensation fixed in Section 35.5 of the Charter of 1932 as amended as of July 1, 1951, for the rank of police officer in the respective years of service, regardless of the rank or position the member held in the department prior to his retirement, or death before retirement. Every service retirement allowance under Section 8.543 which is included in the sentence next preceding, shall be adjusted to what it would have been, if prior to optional modification, the allowance had been 50 percent of said monthly compensation. Allowances payable under Sections 8.547, 8.548 or 8.561 to or on account of persons who were retired for disability or died prior to January 1, 1951, on and after the date such persons would have qualified for service retirement, shall be calculated as provided in said Sections 8.547, 8.548, or 8.561, respectively. The provisions of Section 8.549 with respect to continuance of one-half of retirement allowance upon deaths after retirement, shall be applied from April 1, 1952, as if they were effective on November 2, 1948. This section does not authorize any decrease in any allowance from the amount being paid as of April 1, 1952, nor does this section give any retired member, or any beneficiary of such member, or his successors in interest, any claim against the City and County for any increase in any allowance paid or payable for the time prior to April 1, 1952. Adjustment in reserves under allowances which are changed according to this section, shall be made on the basis of current interest rate and mortality tables. 
		The increase in the retirement allowance shall be apportioned according to services rendered by the member in the same manner that the allowance prior to increase was apportioned. Contributions to the Retirement System, necessary for the payment of the increase of the portion of the retirement allowances which is paid from reserves held by the Retirement System, shall be provided from the reserves held by the Retirement System on account of members under Section 8.544, the necessary amount being transferred upon April 1, 1952, from said reserves to the reserves held by the Retirement System to meet the obligations on account of benefits that have been granted and on account of prior service of members. The contribution being required of the City and County currently, as a percentage of salaries of persons who are members under Section 8.544, shall be increased to a percentage determined by the actuary as necessary to replace the reserves so transferred. Contributions to the Retirement System necessary for the payment of said increases with reference to current and prior service portions of the allowances which are not paid from reserves held by the Retirement System, shall be paid to the system by the City and County by annual appropriations, provided that such appropriation for any year shall not be less than the amount disbursed during that year on account of said increases. 
	(b)	Every retirement or death allowance payable for time commencing on April 1, 1956, to or on account of any person who died or was retired prior to November 8, 1955, as a member of the police department, unless such person was retired or died as a member of the Retirement System or the former police relief and pension fund, under any section of the Charter, other than Section 8.543, or 8.544, is hereby increased by the amount of $25 per month; provided, however, that such increased retirement allowance or death allowance shall not exceed 50 percent of the compensation as of July 1, 1954, attached to the rank of police officer in the fourth year of service as set forth under Section 35.5 of the Charter of 1932, as amended regardless of the rank or position the member held in the department prior to his retirement or death before retirement. 
		Such increase shall not be modified under, nor subject to, Option 2 or 3 provided by ordinance. Allowances payable under Sections 8.547, 8.548, or 8.561, to or on account of persons who were retired for disability or died prior to November 8, 1955, on and after the date such persons would have qualified for service retirement, shall be calculated as provided in said Sections 8.547, 8.548, or 8.561, respectively. 
		This section does not authorize any decrease in any allowance from the amount being paid as of April 1, 1965, nor does this section give any member who retired, or the beneficiary of any member who died prior to April 1, 1956, or his successors in interest, any claim against the City and County for any increase in retirement allowance paid or payable for time prior to April 1, 1956. 
		The increase in allowance shall be apportioned between service rendered prior to the entry of the member into the Retirement System under Section 8.543 or 8.544, and service rendered as such a member, in the same proportion that such prior and current service respectively, bears to the total service credited at retirement. Contributions to the Retirement System necessary for the increases in the allowances provided in this section, shall be provided, with respect to the portion of the benefit based on service rendered as members under Section 8.543 or 8.544 from the reserves held by the Retirement System on account of members of the Retirement System under Section 8.544, the necessary amount being transferred upon April 1, 1956, from said reserves to the reserves held by the Retirement System to meet the obligations on account of allowances which are increased by this Subsection 8.550(b). The contribution being required of the City and County currently, as percentages of salaries of persons who are members under Section 8.543 or 8.544, shall be paid to the system by the City and County by annual appropriations, provided that such appropriation for any year shall not be less than the amount disbursed during that year on account of said increases. 
A8.551  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES BECAUSE OF COMPENSATION BENEFITS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the police department, which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced in the manner fixed by the Board of Supervisors, by the amount of any benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person, under the Workers' Compensation Insurance and Safety Law of the State of California and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of any benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such persons under the said law of the State of California, and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
A8.552  DEATH BENEFITS
	If a member of the police department shall die, before retirement, from causes other than an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, or regardless of cause, if no allowance shall be payable under Sections 8.548 or 8.549 preceding, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
A8.553  REFUNDS AND REDEPOSITS
	Should any member of the police department cease to be employed as such a member, through any cause other than death or retirement or transfer to another office or department, all of his contributions, with interest credited thereon, shall be refunded to him subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar terminations of employment of other members of the Retirement System. If he shall again become a member of the police department, he shall redeposit in the retirement fund the amount refunded to him. Contributions with interest, which are credited because of service rendered in any other office or department and which will not be counted under Section 8.554 to any person who becomes a member of the Retirement System under Section 8.544, shall be refunded to him forthwith. Should a member of the police department become an employee of any other office or department, his accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him as the case may be, to make the accumulated contributions credited to him at the time of change, equal to the amount which would have been credited to him if he had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him in the police department, and he shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his membership in the Retirement System continues. 
A8.554  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the police department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement, and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his service while he was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon re-entry into service: 
	(a)	Time during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a member of the fire or police department. 
	(b)	Time during which said member served and received compensation as a jail matron in the office of the sheriff.
	(c)	Time during which said member is entitled to receive compensation while a member of the Retirement System, because of service rendered in other offices and departments before July 1, 1949, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service, previously refunded, are redeposited, with interest from date of refund to date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the retirement board; and solely for the purpose of determining qualification for retirement under Section 8.547 for disability not resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, time during which said member serves, after June 30, 1949, and receives compensation because of services rendered in other offices and departments. 
	(d)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) next preceding, by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his account. 
A8.555  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for persons who are members under Section 8.544 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	The normal rate of contribution of each member shall be based on his age taken to the next lower complete quarter year, (1) at the date he became a member under Section 8.507 or 8.543, in the case of persons who are members under these sections, or (2) at July 1, 1945, in the case of persons who are members under Section 8.540, and his age taken to the next lower completed quarter year, when he entered the police department, or (3) on his age at the date he becomes a member under Section 8.544, in the case of persons who become members on or after July 1, 1945, without credit for services counted under Section 8.554. The age of entrance into the police department shall be determined by deducting the member's service credited under Section 8.554 as rendered prior to the date upon which his age is based for determination of the rate of contribution according to the sentence next preceding, from said age. The normal rate of contribution of each such member, to be effective from the effective date of membership under Section 8.544, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption, under Section 8.546, one-third of that portion of the service retirement allowance to which he would be entitled, without continuance to dependents, upon first qualifying as to age and service, for retirement under that section, without discount of allowance, which is based on service rendered after the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution according to the first sentence in this paragraph, and assuming the contribution to be made from that date. The normal rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed six percent. 
	(b)	The dependent rate of contribution of each member which shall be required of each member throughout his membership in addition to the normal contributions, and in the same manner as normal contributions, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption under Section 8.546, and upon his first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, one-third of the portion of his allowance, which is to be continued under Section 8.549, after his death and throughout the life of a surviving wife whose age at said death is three years less than the age of said member. If, at the date of retirement for service or retirement for disability resulting from injury received in performance of duty, said member has no wife who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance to her after the death of said member, or upon retirement from disability resulting from other causes regardless of his marital condition, the dependent contributions with accumulated interest thereon, shall be paid to him forthwith. The dependent rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed the difference between six percent and the member's normal rate of contribution, and said dependent rate may be taken as a flat percentage of the member's normal rate, regardless of the age of qualification for service retirement. 
	(c)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section 8.544, a sum determined by applying the member's rates of contribution to such compensation payment. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said members or shall be paid to said member or his estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections 8.552, 8.553, and 8.554. 
	(d)	Contributions based on time included in Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Section 8.554 and deducted prior to July 1, 1945, from compensation of persons who become members under Section 8.544, and standing with interest thereon, to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, shall continue to be credited to the individual accounts of said members and shall be combined with and administered in the same manner as the contributions deducted after said date. 
	(e)	The total contributions, with interest thereon, made by or charged against the City and County and standing to its credit, in the accounts of the Retirement System, on account of persons who become members under Section 8.544, shall be applied to provide the benefits under said section. 
	(f)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 8.555, to provide the benefits payable under this section. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by each member prior to the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution in paragraph (a), Section 8.555 shall not be less during any fiscal year than the amount of such benefits paid during said year. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by respective members on and after the date stated in the next preceding sentence, shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year, to persons who are members under Section 8.544, said percentage to be the ratio of the value on July 1, 1945, or at the late date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system of the benefits thereafter to be paid under this section, from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, and plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said system to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after the date stated in the sentence next preceding, to the value at said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be made every odd-numbered year. 
	(g)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide the benefits under this section, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. Nothing in this section shall affect the obligation of the City and County to pay to the Retirement System any amounts which may or shall become due under the provisions of the Charter prior to July 1, 1945, and which are represented on July 1, 1945, in the accounts of said system by debits against the City and County. 
A8.556  RIGHT TO RETIRE
	Upon the completion of the years of service set forth in Section 8.546 as requisite to retirement, a member of the police department shall be entitled to retire at any time thereafter in accordance with the provisions of said Section 8.546, and nothing shall deprive said member of said right. 
A8.557  LIMITATION ON EMPLOYMENT DURING RETIREMENT
	No person retired as a member under Section 8.544 after June 30, 1945, for service or disability and entitled to receive a retirement allowance under the Retirement System shall serve in any elective or appointive position in the City and County service, including membership on boards and commissions, nor shall such person receive any payment for service rendered to the City and County after retirement, provided that service as an election officer or juror shall not be affected by this section. 
A8.558  DEFINITION OF "FINAL COMPENSATION" – ALLOWANCES FIRST PAYABLE PRIOR TO JULY 1, 1975
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, but solely with respect to the determination of the amount of each retirement allowance payable to or on account of a person who retired for service or because of disability under the provisions of Section 8.544 of the Charter prior to July 1, 1975, "final compensation," for time commencing on July 1, 1975, shall mean the rate of remuneration (excluding remuneration for overtime) attached on July 1, 1975, to the rank or position upon which such person's retirement allowance was determined when first effective; provided, further, that each such allowance shall be increased or decreased as of July 1, 1990, and thereafter on the effective date of any legislation fixing the rates of compensation for police officers under section 8.405 of this Charter by an amount equal to 50 percent of the rate of change in the salary attached to said rank multiplied by the allowance which was payable for the month immediately preceding each July 1. 
	This section does not give any person retired under the provisions of said Section 8.544, or his successors in interest, any claim against the City and County for any increase in any retirement allowance paid or payable for time prior to July 1, 1975. 
	This section does not authorize any decrease in the amount of any allowance from the amount being paid as of June 30, 1975. 
	No retirement allowance to which the definition of "final compensation" as set forth in this section is applicable shall be subject to adjustment under the provisions of Section 8.526 for time commencing July 1, 1975. Contributions, with interest credited thereon, standing to the credit of a person whose retirement allowance is subject to the provisions of this section and which were made by such person pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.526 shall, effective July 1, 1975, be combined with any administered in the same manner as such person's normal contributions. Contributions, with interest credited thereon, made by or charged against the City and County and standing to its credit on account of a person whose retirement allowance is subject to the provisions of this section and which were made by or charged against the City and County for the purposes of said Section 8.526 shall be applied to provide the benefits under this section. 
A8.559  MEMBERS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON AND AFTER JULY 1, 1975
	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.544 of this Charter, members of the police department, as defined in Section 8.559-1, who are members of the Retirement System under Section 8.554 on the effective date of this section and persons who become members of the Retirement System under Section 8.544 after said effective date and prior to July 1, 1975, shall have the option, to be exercised in writing on a form furnished by the Retirement System and to be filed at the office of said system not later than June 30, 1975, of being members of the system under this section instead of said Section 8.544, the election pursuant to said option to be effective as of July 1, 1975; provided that such of said members who, during the period from the effective date of this section through June 30, 1975, are absent by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520(a) of this Charter shall have the same option of electing to be members under this section instead of Section 8.544, until 90 days after their return to service in the police department. 
	Those persons who become members of the police department, as defined in Section 8.559-1, on or after July 1, 1975, and those persons who elect to be members under this section as provided in the preceding paragraph, shall be members of the system subject to provisions of Sections 8.559, 8.559-1, 8.559-2, 8.559-3, 8.559-4, 8.559-5, 8.559-6, 8.559-7, 8.559-8, 8.559-9, 8.559-10, 8.559-11, 8.559-12 and 8.559-13 (which shall apply only to members under Section 8.559) in addition to the provisions contained in Sections 3.670 to 3.672, both inclusive, and Sections 8.500, 8.510 and 8.520 of this Charter, notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of this Charter, and shall not be subject to any of the provisions of Section 8.544 of this Charter. 
A8.559-1  DEFINITIONS
	The following words and phrases as used in this section, Section 8.559 and Sections 8.559-2 through 8.559-13, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, shall have the following meanings: 
	"Retirement allowance," "death allowance" or "allowance," shall mean equal monthly payments, beginning to accrue upon the date of retirement, or upon the day following the date of death, as the case may be, and continuing for life unless a different term of payment is definitely provided by the context. 
	"Compensation," as distinguished from benefits under the Workers' Compensation Insurance and Safety Act of the State of California, shall mean the remuneration payable in cash, by the City and County, without deduction except for absence from duty, for time during which the individual receiving such remuneration is a member of the police department, but excluding remuneration paid for overtime. 
	For retirement purposes, any increase in compensation attached to a rank which is based solely upon the possession of a POST certificate, compared to the equivalent rank without a POST certificate, shall be subject to the following limitations: 
	(a)	for possession of the intermediate POST certificate, no more than 4% shall be included in compensation,
	(b)	for possession of the advanced POST certificate, no more than an additional 2% over the maximum provided in subsection (a), above, shall be included in compensation, 
	These limits shall apply to any pay increments which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate, including but not limited to premiums or special ranks which may be established in the future and which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate. 
	"Compensation earnable" shall mean the compensation which would have been earned had the member received compensation without interruption throughout the period under consideration and at the rates of remuneration attached at that time to the ranks or positions held by him or her during such period, it being assumed that during any absence, he or she was in the rank or position held by him or her at the beginning of the absence, and that prior to becoming a member of the police department, he or she was in the rank or position first held by him or her in such department. 
	"Benefit" shall include "allowance," "retirement allowance," "death allowance" and "death benefit." 
	"Final compensation" shall mean the monthly compensation earnable by a member at the time of his or her retirement, or death before retirement, as the case may be, at the rate of remuneration attached at that time to the rank or position which said member held, provided that said member has held said rank or position for at least one year immediately prior to said retirement or death; and provided, further, that if said member has not held said rank or position for at least one year immediately prior to said retirement or death, "final compensation," as to such member, shall mean the monthly compensation earnable by such member in the rank or position next lower to the rank or position which he or she held at the time of retirement or death at the rate of remuneration attached at the time of said retirement or death to said next lower rank or position; provided, however, that in the case of a member's death before retirement as the result of a violent traumatic injury received in the performance of his or her duty, "final compensation," as to such member shall mean the monthly compensation earnable by such member at the rate of remuneration attached on the date he receives such injury to the rank or position held by such member on that date. 
	For purposes of calculation of final compensation, any increase in pay solely attributable to possession of a POST certificate shall be included only if the member possesses the qualifying POST certificate for a period of not less than four (4) years prior to his or her retirement date; provided, however, that should a member possess the qualifying POST certificate for a period of time less than four (4) years prior to retirement, final compensation shall be calculated based upon the monthly compensation in the next lower rank not requiring possession of the qualifying POST certificate. 
	For the purpose of Sections 8.559 through 8.559-13, the terms "member of the police department," "member of the department," or "member" shall mean any officer or employee of the police department, excluding such officers and employees as are members of the Retirement System under Section 8.565 or Section 8.568 of the Charter, who was or shall be subject to the Charter provisions governing entrance requirements of members of the uniformed force of said department, and said terms further shall mean, from the effective date of their employment in said department, persons employed on July 1, 1975, regardless of age, or employed after said date at an age not greater than the maximum age then prescribed for entrance into employment in said uniformed force, to perform the duties now performed under the titles of criminologist, photographer, police patrol driver, police motor boat operator, woman protective officer, police woman or jail matron. 
	Any police service performed by such members of the police department outside the limits of the City and County and under orders of a superior officer or any such member, shall be considered as City and County service, and any disability or death incurred therein shall be covered under the provisions of the Retirement System. 
	"Retirement system" or "system" shall mean San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System as created in Section 8.500 of the Charter. 
	"Retirement board" shall mean "retirement board" as created in Section 3.670 of the Charter. 
	"Charter" shall mean the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco.

A8.559-2  SERVICE RETIREMENT
	Any member of the police department who completes at least twenty-five (25) service in the aggregate and attains the age of fifty (50) years, said service to be computed under Section 8.559-10, may retire for service at his or her option. A member retired after meeting the service and age requirements in the sentence next preceding, shall receive a retirement allowance equal to fifty-five (55) percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.559-1, plus an allowance at the rate of four percent of said final compensation for each year of service rendered in excess of twenty-five (25) years; provided, however, that such retirement allowance shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of said member's final compensation. A member retired after attaining the age of sixty-five (65) years, but before completing twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate computed under Section 8.559-10, shall receive a retirement allowance which bears the same ratio to fifty (50) percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.559-1, as the service with which he or she is entitled to be credited bears to twenty-five (25) years. If, at the date of retirement for service, or retirement for disability, resulting from an injury received in the performance of duty, said member has no spouse, children or dependent parents, who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance after the death of said member, or with respect to the portion of the allowance which would not be continued regardless of dependents, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, with respect to all of the allowance and regardless of dependents at retirement, a member retired under this section or Section 8.559-3, may elect before the first payment of the retirement allowance is made, to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her allowance or the portion which would not be continued regardless of dependents, as the case may be, partly in a lesser allowance to be received by him or her throughout his or her life, and partly in other benefits payable after his or her death to another person or persons, provided that such election shall be subject to all the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar election by other members of the Retirement System, including the character and amount of such other benefits. 
A8.559-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his duty, shall be retired. If he is not qualified for service retirement, he shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.559-1, as his percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.559-1. Said allowance shall be paid to him until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section 8.559-1, he would have received immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section 8.559-2, he shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he would receive if retired under Section 8.559-2, but not less than 55 percent of said final compensation. Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his duty, by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.559-10, shall be retired upon an allowance of one and one-half percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section 8.559-1 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 331/3 percent of said final compensation; provided, however, that if such member has completed at least 25 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.559-10, but has not yet attained the age of 50 years, he shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance he would have received if he had attained the age of 50 years and retired under Section 8.559-2 as of the date of retirement for such incapacity. The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the police commission, or by said member or his guardian. If his disability shall cease, his retirement allowance shall cease, and he shall be restored to the service in the rank he occupied at the time of his retirement. 
A8.559-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the police department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his surviving wife throughout her life or until her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he had been retired for service on the day of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the final compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement, had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he would have received immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such monthly final compensation. If he had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he was a member under Section 5.559 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be reduced upon the date at which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been reduced had the member not died. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents dependent upon him for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving widow otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife following the death of a member unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
A8.559-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the police department resulting from any cause, other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty; 
	(a)	if his death occurred after qualification for service retirement, under Section 8.559-2, or after retirement for service or because of disability which resulted from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he had retired for service at the time of death or three-fourths of the retirement allowance as it was at his death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout life or until marriage to his surviving wife; or 
	(b)	if his death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, three-fourths of the retirement allowance to which he would have been entitled under Section 8.559-2 if he had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife; or 
	(c)	if his death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, his retirement allowance as it was at his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date of which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died; or 
	(d)	if his death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.559-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section 8.559-3 if he had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty resulting from a cause other than bodily injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving wife otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he had not retired, or unless she was married to the member at least one year prior to his death if he had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section 8.559-4, "surviving wife" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving wife, in the event of death of the member after qualification for but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section 8.559-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to her under this section. If there be no surviving wife, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there be no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "Qualification for service retirement" or "Qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section 8.559 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section 8.559-10. 
A8.559-6  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES
	Every retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of any member under Section 8.559 shall be increased or decreased as of July 1, 1990, and thereafter on the effective date of any legislation fixing the rates of compensation for police officers under section 8.405 of this Charter by an amount equal to 50 percent of any increase or decrease, respectively, in the rate of remuneration attached to the rank or position upon which such retirement or death allowance was based; provided, however, that no allowance shall be reduced below the amount being received by a member or his beneficiary on June 30, 1976, or on the date such member or beneficiary began to receive the allowance, whichever is later. 
A8.559-7  ADJUSTMENT FOR COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the police department which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced in the manner fixed by the Board of Supervisors, by the amount of any benefits other than medical benefits, payable by the City and County to or on account of such person, under any workers' compensation law or any other general law and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
A8.559-8  DEATH BENEFIT
	If a member of the police department shall die, before retirement from causes other than an injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, or regardless of cause, if no allowance shall be payable under Section 8.559-4 or 8.559-5 preceding, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. 
A8.559-9  REFUNDS AND REDEPOSITS
	Should any member of the police department cease to be employed as such a member, through any cause other than death or retirement or transfer to another office or department, all of his or her contributions, with interest credited thereon, shall be refunded to him or her subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar terminations of employment of other members of the Retirement System. If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund, the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the police department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change, equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the police department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues. 
A8.559-10  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the Police Department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time, the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his service while he was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon reentry into service: 
	(a)	Time during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a member of the fire or police department. 
	(b)	Time during which said member served and received compensation as a jail matron in the office of the sheriff.
	(c)	Time during which said member is entitled to receive compensation while a member of the Retirement System, because of service rendered in other offices and departments prior to July 1, 1949, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service previously refunded, are redeposited, with interest from date of refund to date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the Retirement Board; and solely for purpose of determining qualification for retirement under Section 8.559-3 for disability not resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, time during which said member serves, after July 1, 1949, and receives compensation because of services rendered in other offices and departments. 
	(d)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsections (a), (b), or (c) next preceding, by reason of service in the Armed Forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his account. 
	(e)	Time during which said member was on Unpaid Parental Leave pursuant to Charter Section A8.523, and for which said member has purchased service credit in the Retirement System. 
(Amended by Proposition G, 11/4/2008)
A8.559-11  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for members under Section 8.559 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds; 
	(a)	The normal rate of contribution for each member under Section 8.559 shall be based on his age taken to the next lower complete quarter year, (1) at the date he became a member under Section 8.544, in the case of persons who are members under that section, or (2) on his age at the date he becomes a member under Section 8.559 in the case of persons who become members on or after July 1, 1973, without credit for service counted under Section 8.559-10. The age of entrance into the police department shall be determined by deducting the member's service credited under Section 8.559-10 as rendered prior to the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution according to the sentence next preceding, from said age. The normal rate of contribution of each such member, to be effective from the effective date of membership under Section 8.559, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption, under Section 8.559-2, one-third of that portion of the service retirement allowance to which he would be entitled, without continuance to dependents, upon first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, which is based on service rendered after the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution according to the first sentence in this paragraph, and assuming the contribution to be made from that date. The normal rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed seven percent. 
	(b)	The dependent contributions of each member under this section which shall be required of each member throughout his membership in addition to the normal contributions, and in the same manner as normal contributions, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption under Section 8.559-2, and upon his first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, one-third of the portion of his allowance, which is to be continued under Section 8.559-5 after his death and throughout the life of a surviving wife whose age at said death is three years less than the age of said member. If, at the date of retirement for service or retirement for disability resulting from injury received in performance of duty, said member has no wife who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance to her after the death of said member, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, regardless of his marital conditions, the dependent contributions with accumulated interest thereon, shall be paid to him forthwith. The dependent rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed the difference between seven percent and the member's normal rate of contribution, and said dependent rate may be taken as a flat percentage of the member's normal rate, regardless of the age of qualification for service retirement. 
	(c)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under this section, a sum determined by applying the member's rates of contribution to such compensation payment. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other member of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections 8.559-8, 8.559-9 and 8.559-10. The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest. 
	(d)	Contributions based on time included in Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 8.559-10, and deducted prior to July 1, 1975, from compensation of persons who become members under Section 8.559, and standing with interest thereon, to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, together with contributions made by such members pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.526 and standing with interest thereon to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, shall continue to be credited to the individual accounts of said members and shall be combined with and administered in the same manner as the contributions deducted after said date. 
	(e)	The total contributions, with interest thereon, made by or charged against the City and County and standing to its credit, in the accounts of the Retirement System, on account of persons who become members under Section 8.559, shall be applied to provide the benefits under said Section 8.559. 
	(f)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 8.559-11 to provide the benefits payable to members under Section 8.559. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by each member prior to the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution in Subsection (a) of this Section 8.559-11, shall not be less during any fiscal year than the amount of such benefits paid during said year. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by respective members on and after the date stated in the next preceding sentence, shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year, to persons who are members under Section 8.559, said percentage to be the ratio of the value on July 1, 1975, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid under this section, from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, and plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said systems to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after the date stated in the sentence next preceding, to the value of said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be every odd-numbered year. 
	(g)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide the benefits under this section, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. Nothing in this section shall affect the obligations of the City and County to pay to the Retirement System any amounts which may or shall become due under the provisions of the Charter prior to July 1, 1975, and which are represented on said effective date, in the accounts of said system by debits against the City and County. 
(Amended by Proposition G, 11/4/2008)
A8.559-12  RIGHT TO RETIRE
	Upon the completion of the years of service set forth in Section 8.559-2 as requisite to retirement, a member of the police department shall be entitled to retire at any time thereafter in accordance with the provisions of said Section 8.559-2, and nothing shall deprive said member of said right. 
A8.559-13  LIMITATION IN EMPLOYMENT DURING RETIREMENT
	Except as otherwise provided in section 8.511 of this Charter, no person retired as a member under Section 8.559 for service or disability and entitled to receive a retirement allowance under the Retirement System shall serve in any elective or appointive position in the City and County service, including membership on boards and commissions, nor shall such person receive any payment for service rendered to the City and County after retirement, provided that service as an election officer or juror, or in the preparation for, or the giving of, testimony as an expert witness for or on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco before any court or legislative body shall not be affected by this section. 
A8.559-14  RIGHT TO TRANSFER
	Notwithstanding any provisions of this Charter to the contrary, any person who, on or after January 1, 1981, is a member of the Police Department, and is a member of the Retirement System under Charter Section 8.559, may become a member of the Retirement System under Charter Section 8.586 by filing in writing with the Retirement System no later than December 31, 1981, an executed waiver of all benefits which might inure to him under Charter Section 8.559. This waiver must be without right of revocation and on a form furnished by the Retirement System. The Retirement Board may require that this waiver be executed by additional persons before it becomes operative. 
	This transfer will be effective July 1, 1980. Those persons so electing to become members under Charter Section 8.586 shall receive service credit under Charter Section 8.586 equal to their service credit under Charter Section 8.559 as of June 30, 1980. 
	Those persons so electing to become members under Charter Section 8.586 shall not be subject to any of those provisions of Charter Section 8.559 as of July 1, 1980. 
	Notwithstanding the provisions of Charter Section 8.526, the cost of living adjustment in any given year prior to January 1, 2000 for those persons electing this transfer to Charter Section 8.586 shall not exceed the provisions of Charter Section 8.526 as they existed on July 1, 1980. 
	Those persons so electing to transfer membership from Charter Section 8.559 to Charter Section 8.586 shall receive a monetary consideration not to exceed $40,000 calculated at the rate of $2,500 for each year of said service credit up to ten years and then at the rate of $1000 for each additional year of said service credit. This monetary consideration shall be paid from said member's contribution account including any interest thereon. When said member's contribution account is depleted, the balance shall be paid from the City and County contributions held by the Retirement System. 
	This consideration shall be payable January 1, 1982. Alternatively, an employee may elect to receive payments according to a schedule established by the Retirement Board. 
	Notwithstanding any other Charter or ordinance provisions, a member transferring pursuant to this section shall be eligible to receive any benefits payable because of an increase in benefits approved by the voters for other members under Charter Section 8.586, provided, however, that said member repays with interest the monetary consideration he or she received in making this transfer, offset by the amount of said member's own account in the Retirement System under Charter Section 8.559. Interest on the repayment amount shall be charged at the rate credited to member accounts from January 1, 1981 until repayment or effective date of retirement. Members shall have the option of making said repayment either through a lump-sum payment, payroll deduction or through an actuarial offset against any benefits payable because of an increase in benefits subsequent to July 1, 1980. 
	The amendments to this section contained in the proposition submitted to the electorate on November 2, 1999 shall apply only to active and retired members on November 2, 1999 and constitute a prospective increase in benefits to such members subject to repayment in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph. Upon repayment, retirees shall have their benefits recalculated under Charter Section 8.586 as in force at the date of their retirement. These recalculated benefits shall be first payable on and after November 2, 1999. No retired member shall become eligible under said amendments for any retroactive payments. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the provisions in Charter Section 8.586-3 for recalculation on the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement ("QSR") shall use the provisions of Charter Section 8.586 at QSR. 
(Amended November 1999)

	Should any member of the police department who is a member of the Retirement System under Charter section 8.559, with five years of credited service, cease to be so employed, through any cause other than death or retirement, he or she shall have the right to elect, without right of revocation and within 90 days after termination of said service, to allow his or her accumulated contributions including interest to remain in the retirement fund and to receive a retirement benefit calculated at termination, defined as that proportion of the normal service retirement benefit that his or her accrued service credit bears to 25 years, payable beginning at age 50. 
	Any member of the police department convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed in connection with his or her duties as a member of the police department shall, upon termination of his or her employment pursuant to the provisions of this Charter, forfeit all right to any benefits under this section except refund of his or her accumulated contributions. 
	Every retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of any member under Section 8.559-15 shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.559-6 provided that if the member's accrued service credit is less than 25 years the section 8.559-6 adjustment will be multiplied by a fraction where the denominator is 25 and the numerator is equal to the member's accrued service credit at the date of termination. 
A8.560  DEFINITION, MEMBERS OF FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT
	For the purpose of the Retirement System, any officer or employee of the police or the fire departments whose employment therein began prior to January 1, 1900, or whose employment therein began on or shall begin after that date and was or shall be subject to a Charter maximum age at the time of employment of not over 35 years, shall be considered to be a member of the police department or the fire department, respectively. Any fire or police service outside the limits of the City and County performed by a member of the Retirement System and under orders of a superior officer of any such member, shall be considered as City and County service, and any disability or death incurred therein shall be covered under the provisions of the Retirement System. 
A8.561  PENSION PROVISIONS – DEPENDENT OF MEMBERS OF FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY
	If a member of the fire or police departments, as defined in the Charter for the purposes of the Retirement System, or a member of the salvage corps in the fire department, or any person employed by the City and County to perform duties now performed under the titles of pilots of fireboats, marine engineer of fireboats, or marine fireman of fireboats, all of whom are hereinafter designated as members, shall die before or after retirement as a result of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his duty, a monthly allowance, in lieu of any allowance payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his surviving wife throughout her life or until her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he had been retired for service on the day of death, but such allowances shall not be less than one-half of the average monthly compensation earnable by said member during the three years immediately preceding death, and if he had retired prior to death, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement, had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the average monthly compensation he would have received during the three years immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than one-half of such average monthly compensation. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, of if she die or remarry before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents dependent upon him for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving widow otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this subsection to a surviving wife following the death of a member unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which result in death. 
	Benefits provided under this section shall be in lieu of all benefits payable under other sections of the Charter upon death of such member resulting from an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, except the five hundred dollar benefit payable upon death after retirement. 
	Contributions to provide the allowance under this section shall be made to the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System by the City and County. The amount of the contribution shall be determined and payment to the system shall be made in the same manner as contributions are determined and paid which are required for other benefits provided under the Retirement System for the respective groups of members who are included under this section. 
	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, any member of the salvage corps in the fire department, or any person employed by the City and County to perform duties now performed under the titles of pilot of fire boats, marine engineer of fire boats, or marine fireman of fire boats, who becomes incapacitated for performance of his duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by, the performance of his duty, shall receive the same benefits as members of the fire department who are members of the Retirement System under Section 8.567 of the Charter. 
A8.562  CREDIT FOR SERVICE IN UNDERWRITERS' FIRE PATROL
	Any person who is a member under Section 8.568 on February 1, 1970, and who was employed in the uniformed force of the Underwriters' Fire Patrol of San Francisco prior to becoming such a member shall have the right to elect to make contributions pursuant to this section and to receive credit as service under the Retirement System for all or any part of the time he was so employed. 
	Said election shall be made in writing on a form provided by the Retirement System and filed with the retirement board within 90 days after February 1, 1970. 
	Any such member who elects to make contributions and receive such credit shall contribute to the retirement fund an amount equal to the sum of: 
	(a)	contributions computed by applying the rate of contribution applicable to him on the date he elected to receive credit for such service to the monthly compensation earnable by him on said date multiplied by the number of months of such service for which he has elected to receive credit; and 
	(b)	interest on the unpaid balance of said contributions, commencing on the date of the member's election to make such contributions, at the rate of interest currently being used from time to time under the Retirement System. 
	Payment of the contributions required by this section shall be made in a lump sum or by installment payments. Installment payments shall be made at times and in a manner fixed by the retirement board, provided that the period for completion of such payments shall not extend beyond the effective date of the member's retirement. 
	Upon completion of payment of contributions in the amount specified in this section, the member shall be credited with service under the Retirement System in an amount equal to the service for which he has elected to receive credit pursuant to this section. The service with which the member is so credited shall be credited as current service. 
A8.565  MEMBERS OF FIRE DEPARTMENT ON JANUARY 8, 1932
	Persons who are members of the fire department on the eighth day of January, 1932, shall become members of the Retirement System on the date, subject only to the following provisions, in addition to the provisions contained in Sections 3.670-3.672, 8.500-8.502, 8.510, 8.511, 8.520, and 8.560 of this Charter. 
	(a)	Any member of the fire department who shall have completed 25 years of continuous service as a member of the fire department next preceding the date of his retirement, or any member of the fire department who shall have reached the age of 55 years and shall have completed 20 years of continuous service as a member of the fire department next preceding the date of his retirement, may retire from service at his option. Any member of the fire department who shall become physically disabled by reason of any bodily injury received in the performance of his duty may be retired from service on satisfactory proof thereof. The retirement board, by unanimous vote, may retire from service any aged, disabled or infirm member of the fire department who has arrived at the age of 60 years and who has completed 20 years of continuous service as a member of the department next preceding such age, who may be ascertained to be, by reason of such age, infirmity or other disability, unfit for the performance of his duties. 
		Such retired member shall receive a monthly pension, payable throughout his life, equal to one-half the amount of the salary attached to the rank held by him three years prior to the date of his retirement hereinafter referred to as "pension" in this and the following section; provided that where such retirement is based on disability alone, in case the disability of such member shall cease, his pension shall cease, and he shall be restored to service in the rank he occupied at the time of his retirement. Should any said retired member die leaving a widow, who shall have been married to the decedent at least one year prior to the date of his retirement, such widow shall, as long as she may live and remain unmarried, be paid said pension; provided, further, that the widow of any said retired member who married said member after the effective date of his retirement and at least one year prior to his death shall be paid pension for time after December 31, 1974, as long as she may live and remain unmarried; provided, further, that should widow die leaving a child or children under the age of 16 years, said pension shall continue to be paid such children collectively until the youngest child arrives at the age of 16 years; and provided further, that should said retired member die leaving no widow but leaving an orphan child or children under the age of 16 years, such child or children collectively shall receive said pension until the youngest child attains the age of 16 years. 
	(b)	The family of any member of the fire department who shall die as a result of any injury received during the performance of his duty, or from sickness clearly, unmistakably and directly caused by and resulting from the discharge of such duty, or while eligible for a pension on account of years of service in the department, or who has served 20 consecutive years in the department and attained the age of 55 years, shall receive the following benefits. 
		First, should the decedent leave a widow to whom he was married prior to the date of the injury resulting in death, his widow shall, as long as she may live and remain unmarried, be paid a monthly pension equal to one- half of the salary attached to the rank held by the decedent at the time of his said injury; provided that the widow of any said retired member who married said member after the effective date of his retirement and at least one year prior to his death shall be paid pension for time after December 31, 1974, as long as she may live and remain unmarried; provided, however, that should said widow die, leaving a child or children under the age of 16 years, said pension shall continue to such child or children collectively until the youngest child arrives at the age of 16 years. 
		Second, should the decedent leave no widow, but leave an orphan child or children under the age of 16 years, such child or such children collectively shall receive said pension until the youngest child attains the age of 16 years. 
		Third, should the decedent leave no widow and no orphan child or children, but leave a parent or parents dependent solely upon him for support, such parents so depending shall collectively receive said pension during such time as the retirement board may unanimously determine its necessity. 
	(c)	When any member of the department shall die from natural causes and before retirement, and when no pension is payable to his widow or children, there shall be paid to his estate or beneficiary a death benefit, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. 
		Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
	(d)	In addition to the other contributions required of the City and County under the Retirement System, the City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System during each fiscal year a sum which shall be equal to the liabilities accruing under the Retirement System because of service rendered during such year by persons becoming members on the eighth day of January, 1932, under this section. If, subsequent to such fiscal year, it shall be determined that such contribution by the City and County was not sufficient to meet such liability, then the City and County shall make such additional contribution as may be necessary to make up the deficit. 
	(e)	No benefits shall be provided under the Retirement System for, nor shall any contributions be required of, persons who become members of the Retirement System under this section, in addition to the benefits specifically provided and contributions specifically required in such section. Any pension payable because of the death or retirement of any such person shall be reduced in the manner fixed by the Board of Supervisors, by the amount of any benefits payable to or on account of such person, under the Workers' Compensation Insurance and Safety Law of the State of California. 
	(f)	Persons who are members of the fire department on the eighth day of January, 1932, shall have the option, to be exercised in writing on or before the first day of July, 1932, of becoming members of the Retirement System under the provisions of Section 8.567, which applies to persons who become members of the department after the eighth day of January, 1932. If such persons shall affirmatively exercise such option within the time specified, then they shall not receive any benefit under this section, but shall become members of the Retirement System and shall receive benefits and make contributions on the same basis as persons who become members of the department after the eighth day of January, 1932, provided that a pension for each person affirmatively exercising such option shall be payable on account of service rendered to the City and County prior to the eighth day of January, 1932, by contributions of the City and County, which pension shall be the same percentage, regardless of the age of retirement of his final compensation, as defined by the Board of Supervisors, for each year of service, as the contributions of the member and the City and County are calculated to provide upon retirement at age 55 for each year of service rendered as a member of the Retirement System. 
	The amendments of Subsections (a), and (b), of this section contained in the proposition therefor submitted to the electorate on November 5, 1974, do not and shall not give any person any claim against the City and County for any pension for time prior to January 1, 1975. 
A8.566  FIRE DEPARTMENT – RETIRED MEMBERS AND BENEFICIARIES ON JANUARY 8, 1932
	Any member of the fire department who shall have been retired on or after January 21, 1925, or prior to January 1, 1900, and shall be receiving a pension on the eighth day of January, 1932, and any widow, child, children or parents of a deceased member of the department who shall be receiving a pension on the eighth day of January, 1932, shall continue to receive such pension subject to the provisions of Section 8.565 governing the payment of pensions to retired members, widows, children and parents.

Such pensions shall be paid by the Retirement System, but no other benefits shall be provided for such retired members, widows, children or parents; except that upon the death of any such member who is receiving a pension under this section and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors. 
A8.567  MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT – JANUARY 8, 1932 TO JULY 1, 1949
	Persons who become members of the fire department after the eighth day of January, 1932 and prior to July 1, 1949, shall become members of the Retirement System subject only to the following provision in addition to the provisions contained in Sections 3.670-3.672, 8.500-8.502, 8.510, 8.511, 8.520, 8.525 and 8.560 of this Charter.

It may be provided, however, under such Retirement System, that members may retire after 30 years of continuous service; the benefits at retirement in such cases to be determined, because of retirement at an age below 55, in accordance with the tables recommended by the actuary and approved by said retirement board.

	Members of the fire department, as defined in Section 8.569, who are members of the Retirement System under Sections 8.507, 8.509, or 8.567 of the Charter on the first day of July, 1949, and persons who become members of said department after said date, shall be members of the Retirement System under this Section 8.568 on and after said date, and shall be subject to the following provisions of Section 8.568 and Sections 8.569, 8.570, 8.571, 8.572, 8.573, 8.575, 8.576, 8.577, 8.578, 8.579, 8.580, 8.581 in addition to the provisions contained in Sections 3.670-3.672, 8.500-8.504, 8.506, 8.510 and 8.520 of this Charter notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of the Charter. Members of the said department who are members of the Retirement System under Sections 8.507 or 8.509 of the Charter, on July 1, 1950, however, shall have the option to be exercised in writing, on a form furnished by the Retirement System and to be filed at the office of said system not later than 90 days after said date, of being members of the system under Sections 8.507 or 8.509 instead of Section 8.568, the election under said option to be effective on said date, provided, that members who are absent by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, on July 1, 1949, shall have the same option of electing to be members under Sections 8.507 or 8.509, as the case may be, instead of Section 8.568 until 90 days after their return to service in the fire department.

	Any member of the fire department who completes at least 25 years of service in the aggregate and attains the age of 50 years, said service to be computed under Section 8.578, may retire for service at his option. Members shall be retired on the first day of the month next following the attainment by them of the age of 65 years. A member retired after meeting the service and age requirements in the two sentences next preceding, shall receive a retirement allowance equal to 55 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.569, plus an allowance at the rate of three percent of said final compensation, for each year of service rendered in excess of 25 years; provided, however, that such retirement allowance shall not exceed 70 percent of said member's final compensation. A member retired after attaining the age of 65 years, but before completing 25 years of service in the aggregate computed under Section 8.578, shall receive a retirement allowance which bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.569, as the service with which he is entitled to be credited, bears to 25 years. If, at the date of retirement for service, or retirement for disability resulting from an injury received in performance of duty, said member has no wife, children or dependent parents, who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance after death of said member, or with respect to the portion of the allowance which would not be continued regardless of dependents, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, with respect to all of the allowance and regardless of dependents at retirement, a member retired under this section, or Section 8.571, may elect before the first payment of the retirement allowance is made, to receive the actuarial equivalent of his allowance or the portion which would not be continued regardless of dependents, as the case may be, partly in a lesser allowance to be received by him throughout his life, and partly in other benefits payable after his death to another person or persons, provided that such election shall be subject to all the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar election by other members of the Retirement System, including the character and amount of such other benefits. 
A8.571  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the fire department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by performance of his duty, shall be retired. If he is not qualified for service retirement, he shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.569, as his percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.569. Said allowance shall be paid to him until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section 8.569, he would have received immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such final compensation. 
	If at the time of retirement because of disability, he is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section 8.570, he shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he would receive if retired under Section 8.570, but not less than 55 percent of said final compensation. Any member of the fire department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his duty, by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.578, shall be retired upon an allowance of one and one-half percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section 8.569 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 33% percent of said final compensation; provided, however, that if such member has completed at least 25 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.578, but has not yet attained the age of 50 years, he shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance he would have received if he had attained the age of 50 years and retired under Section 8.570 as of the date of retirement for such incapacity. The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the fire commission, or by said member or his guardian. If his disability shall cease, his retirement allowance shall cease, and he shall be restored to the service in the rank he occupied at the time of his retirement. 
	The amendments of this Section 8.571 contained in the proposition therefor submitted to the electorate on November 7, 1972, are hereby declared to be retroactive and shall be applicable to members who retired after October 1, 1970. 
A8.572  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the fire department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his surviving wife throughout her life or until her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he had been retired for service on the day of death, but such allowances shall not be less than 55 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the final compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement, had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he would have received immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such monthly final compensation. If he had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member except that if he was a member under Section 8.568 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be reduced upon the date at which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been reduced had the member not died. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she die or remarry before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents dependents upon him for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving widow otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife following the death of a member unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
A8.573  PAYMENTS TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the fire department resulting from any cause, other than an injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty: 
	(a)	if his death occurred after qualification for service retirement, under Section 8.570, or after retirement for service or because of disability which resulted from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he had retired for service at the time of death or three-fourths of the retirement allowance as it was at his death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife; or 
	(b)	if his death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, three-fourths of the retirement allowance to which he would have been entitled under Section 8.570 if he had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife; or 
	(c)	if his death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, his retirement allowance as it was at his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date of which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died; or 
	(d)	if his death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.578, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section 8.571 if he had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty resulting from a cause other than bodily injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she die or remarry before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving wife otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he had not retired, or unless she was married to the member at least one year prior to his death if he had retired. 
	As used in this section and in Section 8.572, "surviving wife" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving wife, in the event of death of the member after qualification for but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section 8.576, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to her under this section. If there be no surviving wife, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there be no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. Persons heretofore retired under Charter Section 8.567, as members of the fire department at the time of retirement, shall be subject to the provisions of this section. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section 8.568 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section 8.578. 
	The amendments of this Section 8.573 contained in the proposition therefor submitted to the electorate on November 7, 1972, are hereby declared to be retroactive and shall be applicable to members who died after October 1, 1970. 
A8.574  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES
	Every allowance based on the average monthly compensation earnable by the member during the 10 years prior to retirement, and payable for time commencing on February 1, 1957, to or on account of persons who were retired, as members under Section 8.567, for disability resulting from bodily injury received in the performance of duty, shall be adjusted to the amount it would be, if it had been based on the monthly compensation fixed by the Board of Supervisors as of July 1, 1956, for the rank or position held by such retired member in the fire department prior to retirement. This section does not authorize any decrease in any allowance from the amount being paid as of February 1, 1957, nor does this section give any retired member, or any beneficiary of such member, or his successors in interest, any claim against the City and County for any increase in any allowance paid or payable for the time prior to February 1, 1957. Adjustment in reserves under allowances which are changed according to this section, shall be made on the basis of current interest rate and mortality tables. 
	The increase in the retirement allowance shall be apportioned according to service rendered by the member in the same manner that the allowance prior to increase was apportioned. Contributions to the Retirement System, necessary for the payment of the increase of the portion of the retirement allowances which is paid from reserves held by the Retirement System, shall be provided from the reserves held by the Retirement System on account of members under Section 8.568, the necessary amount being transferred upon February 1, 1957, from said reserves to the reserves held by the Retirement System to meet the obligations on account of benefits that have been granted and on account of prior service of members. The contribution being required of the City and County currently, as a percentage of salaries of persons who are members under Section 8.568, shall be increased to a percentage determined by the actuary as necessary to replace the reserves so transferred. Contributions to the Retirement System necessary for the payment of said increases with reference to current and prior service portions of the allowance which are not paid from reserves held by the Retirement System, shall be paid to the system by the City and County by annual appropriations, provided that such appropriation for any year shall not be less than the amount disbursed during that year on account of said increases. 
A8.575  ADJUSTMENT FOR COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the fire department which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced in the manner fixed by the Board of Supervisors, by the amount of any benefits other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person, under the Workers' Compensation Insurance and Safety Law of the State of California and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under said law of the State of California and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
A8.576  DEATH BENEFIT
	If a member of the fire department shall die, before retirement, from causes other than an injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, or regardless of cause, if no allowance shall be payable under Section 8.572 or 8.573 preceding, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. 
A8.577  REFUNDS AND REDEPOSITS
	Should any member of the fire department cease to be employed as such member, through any cause other than death or retirement or transfer to another office or department, all of his contributions, with interest credited thereon, shall be refunded to him subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar terminations of employment of other members of the Retirement System. If he shall again become a member of the department, he shall redeposit in the retirement fund, the amount refunded to him. Contributions, with interest, which are credited because of service rendered in any other office or department and which will not be counted under Section 8.578, to any person who becomes a member of the Retirement System under this sections, shall be refunded to him forthwith. Should a member of the fire department become an employee of any other office or department, his accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payment, to or from him as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him at the time of change, equal to the amount which would have been credited to him if he had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him in the fire department and he shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his membership in the Retirement System continues. 
A8.578  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the fire department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement, and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time, the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his service while he was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon re-entry into service: 
	(a)	Time during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a member of the fire or police department. 
	(b)	Time during which said member is entitled to receive compensation while a member of the Retirement System, because of service rendered in other offices and departments prior to July 1, 1949, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service, previously refunded, are redeposited, with interest from date of refund to date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the retirement board and solely for purpose of determining qualification for retirement under Section 8.571 for disability not resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, time during which said member serves, after July 1, 1949, and receives compensation because of services rendered in other offices and departments. 
	(c)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsections (a) and (b) next preceding, by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his account. 
A8.579  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for members under Section 8.568 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	The normal rate of contribution of each member under this section shall be based on his age taken to the next lower complete quarter year, (1) at the earlier of the dates he became a member under Section 8.507, 8.509 or 8.567, in the case of persons who are members under these sections, or (2) on his age at the date he becomes a member under Section 8.568 in the case of persons who become members on or after July 1, 1949, without credit for service counted under Section 8.578. The age of entrance into the fire department shall be determined by deducting the member's service credited under Section 8.578 as rendered prior to the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution according to the sentence next preceding, from said age. The normal rate of contribution of each such member, to be effective from the effective date of membership under Section 8.568, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption, under Section 8.570, one-third of that portion of the service retirement allowance to which he would be entitled, without continuance to dependents, upon first qualifying as to age and service, for retirement under that section, which is based on service rendered after the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution according to the first sentence in this paragraph, and assuming the contribution to be made from that date. The normal rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed six percent. 
	(b)	The dependent contributions of each member under this section which shall be required of each member throughout his membership in addition to the normal contributions, and in the same manner as normal contributions, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption under Section 8.570, and upon his first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, one-third of the portion of his allowance, which is to be continued under Section 8.573 after his death and throughout the life of a surviving wife whose age at said death is three years less than the age of said member. If, at the date of retirement for service or retirement for disability resulting from injury received in performance of duty, said member has no wife who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance to her after the death of said member, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, regardless of his marital condition, the dependent contributions with accumulated interest thereon, shall be paid to him forthwith. The dependent rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed the difference between six percent and the member's normal rate of contributions, and said dependent rate may be taken as a flat percentage of the member's normal rate, regardless of the age of qualification for service retirement. 
	(c)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under this section, a sum determined by applying the member's rates of contribution to such compensation payment. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections 8.576, 8.577 and 8.578. 
	(d)	Contributions based on time included in Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 8.578, and deducted prior to July 1, 1949, from compensation of persons who become members under Section 8.568, and standing with interest thereon, to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, shall continue to be credited to the individual accounts of said members and shall be combined with and administered in the same manner as the contributions deducted after said date. 
	(e)	The total contributions, with interest thereon, made by or charged against the City and County and standing to its credit, in the accounts of the Retirement System, on account of persons who become members under Section 8.568, shall be applied to provide the benefits under said section. 
	(f)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section 8.579, to provide the benefits payable under this section. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by each member prior to the date upon which his age is based for determination of his rate of contribution in Subsection (a) Section 8.579, shall not be less during any fiscal year than the amount of such benefits paid during said year. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by respective members on and after the date stated in the next preceding sentence, shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year, to persons who are members under Section 8.568, said percentage to be the ratio of the value on July 1, 1949, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid under this section, from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, and plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said systems to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after the date stated in the sentence next preceding, to the value of said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be every odd-numbered year. 
	(g)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide the benefits under this section, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. Nothing in this section shall affect the obligations of the City and County to pay to the Retirement System any amounts which may or shall become due under the provisions of the Charter prior to July 1, 1949, and which are represented on said effective date, in the accounts of said system by debits against the City and County. 
A8.580  RIGHT TO RETIRE
	Upon the completion of the years of service set forth in Section 8.570 as requisite to retirement, a member of the fire department shall be entitled to retire at any time thereafter in accordance with the provisions of said Section 8.570, and nothing shall deprive said member of said right. 
A8.581  LIMITATION ON EMPLOYMENT DURING RETIREMENT
	No person retired as a member under Section 8.568 for service or disability and entitled to receive a retirement allowance under the Retirement System shall serve in any elective or appointive position in the City and County service, including membership on boards and commissions, nor shall such person receive any payment for service rendered to the City and County after retirement, provided that service as an election officer or juror shall not be affected by this section.

	This section does not authorize any decrease in the amount of any allowance from the amount being paid as of June 30, 1975. 
	No retirement allowance to which the definition of "final compensation" as set forth in this section is applicable shall be subject to adjustment under the provisions of Section 8.526 for time commencing July 1, 1975. Contributions, with interest credited thereon, standing to the credit of a person whose retirement allowance is subject to the provisions of this section and which were made by such person pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.526 shall, effective July 1, 1975, be combined with and administered in the same manner as such person's normal contributions.

	In no event shall a member's retirement allowance exceed seventy percent of his average final compensation. 
	Before the first payment of a retirement allowance is made, a member, retired under this section or Section 8.584-3, may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of his allowance, partly in an allowance to be received by him throughout his life, and partly in other benefits payable after his death to another person or persons, provided that such election shall be subject to all the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar elections by other members of the Retirement System, including the character and amount, of such other benefits; provided, however, that at any time within 30 days after the date on which his compulsory retirement would otherwise have become effective, a member who has attained the age of 65 years may elect, without right of revocation, to withdraw his accumulated contributions, said election to be exercised in writing on a form furnished by the Retirement System and filed at the office of said system and a member so electing shall be considered as having terminated his membership in said system on the date immediately preceding the date on which his compulsory retirement would otherwise have become effective and he shall be paid forthwith his accumulated contributions, with interest credited thereon. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.514 of this Charter, the portion of service retirement allowance provided by the City and County's contributions shall be not less than $100 per month upon retirement after thirty years of service and after attaining the age of 60 years, and provided further that as to any member within 15 years or more of service at the compulsory retirement age of 65, the portion of the service retirement allowance provided by the City and County's contribution shall be such that the total retirement allowance shall not be less than $100 per month.

Part-time service and compensation shall be reduced to full-time service and compensation in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, and when so reduced shall be applied on full-time service and compensation in the calculation of retirement allowances. 
A8.584-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY

In the calculation under this section of the retirement allowance of a member having credit for service in a position in the evening schools and service in any other position, separate retirement allowances shall be calculated, in the manner prescribed, for each class of service, the average final compensation in each case being that for the respective class of service; provided that the average final compensation upon which the minimum total retirement allowance is calculated in such case shall be based on the compensation earnable by the member in the classes of service rendered by him during the three years immediately preceding his retirement. Part-time service and compensation shall be reduced to full-time service and compensation in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, and when so reduced shall be applied as full-time service and compensation in the calculation of retirement allowances. The question of retiring a member under this subsection may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of any commission or board, or by said member or his guardian. If his disability shall cease, his retirement allowance shall cease, and he shall be restored to service in the position or classification he occupied at the time of his retirement.

	(a)	If no benefit is payable under subsection (b) of this section:

		(2)	If a member sustains a traumatic bodily injury through external and violent means in the course and scope of employment and death results within 180 days of such injury, an additional insurance benefit of 12 months of compensation earnable shall be paid to the member's estate or designated beneficiary. 
	(b)	If, at the date of his death, he was qualified for service retirement by reason of service and age under the provisions of Section 8.584-2, and he has designated as beneficiary his surviving spouse, who was married to him for at least one full year immediately prior to the date of his death, one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he had retired for service on the date of his death shall be paid to such surviving spouse who was his designated beneficiary at the date of his death, until such spouse's death or remarriage, or if there be no surviving spouse, to the unmarried child or children of such member under the age of 18 years, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If, at the death of such surviving spouse, who was receiving an allowance under this Subsection (b), there be one or more unmarried children of such member under the age of 18 years, such allowance shall continue to such child or children, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subsection (b) is less than the benefit which was otherwise payable under Subsection (a) of this section, the amount of said benefit payable under Subsection (a) less an amount equal to the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subsection (b) shall be paid in a lump sum as follows: 
		(1)	If the person last entitled to said allowance is the remarried surviving spouse of such member, to such spouse.
		(2)	Otherwise, to the surviving children of the member, share and share alike, or if there are no such children, to the estate of the person last entitled to said allowance. 
	The surviving spouse may elect, on a form provided by the Retirement System and filed in the office of the Retirement System before the first payment of the allowance provided herein, to receive the benefit provided in Subsection (a) of this section in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be payable under the provisions of this subdivision. If a surviving spouse, who was entitled to make the election herein provided, shall die before or after making such election but before receiving any payment pursuant to such election, then the legally appointed guardian of the unmarried children of the member under the age of 18 years may make the election herein provided before any benefit has been paid under this section, for and on behalf of such children if in his judgment it appears to be in their interest and advantage, and the election so made shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties in interest. 
	If any person other than such surviving spouse shall have and be paid a community property interest in any portion of any benefit provided under this section, any allowance payable under this Subsection (b) shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent, at the date of the member's death, of the amount of benefits paid to such other person. 
	Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
	Upon the death of a member after retirement, an allowance, in addition to the death benefit provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, shall be paid to his surviving spouse, until such surviving spouse's death or remarriage, equal to one-half of his retirement allowance as it was prior to optional modification and prior to reduction as provided in Subsection (a) of Section 8.514 of this Charter, but exclusive of the part of such allowance which was provided by additional contributions. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this paragraph to a surviving spouse unless such surviving spouse was married to said member at least one year prior to his retirement. If such retired person leaves no such surviving spouse, or if such surviving spouse should die or remarry before every child of such deceased retired person attains the age of 18 years, the allowance which such surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to retired person's child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. 
	The amendments of this section contained in the proposition submitted to the electorate on November 6, 1984 are hereby declared to be prospective and shall not give any person a claim against the City and County relating to a death prior to ratification of this amendment by the State Legislature. 
A8.584-6  BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP
	Should any miscellaneous member cease to be employed as such a member, through any cause other than death or retirement, all of his contributions, with interest credited thereon, shall be refunded to him subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to cover similar terminations of employment and re-employment with and without redeposit of withdrawn accumulated contributions of other members of the Retirement System, provided that, if such member is entitled to be credited with at least five years of service, he shall have the right to elect, without right of revocation and within 90 days after said termination of service, or if the termination was by lay-off, 90 days after the retirement board determines the termination to be permanent, whether to allow his accumulated contributions to remain in the retirement fund and to receive benefits only as provided in this paragraph. Failure to make such election shall be deemed an irrevocable election to withdraw his accumulated contributions. A person who elects to allow his accumulated contributions to remain in the retirement fund shall be subject to the same age requirements as apply to other members under Section 8.584 for service retirement but he shall not be subject to a minimum service requirement. Upon the qualification of such member for retirement by reason of age, he shall be entitled to receive a retirement allowance which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his accumulated contributions and an equal amount of the contributions of the City and County, plus 12/3 percent of his average final compensation for each year of service credited to him as rendered prior to his first membership in the Retirement System. Upon the death of such member prior to retirement, his contributions with interest credited thereon shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary. 
A8.584-7  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time and service shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member for the purpose of determining whether such member qualifies for retirement and calculating benefits: 
	(a)	Time during which said member is a member of the Retirement System under Section 8.584 and during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a miscellaneous officer or employee. 
	(b)	Service in the fire and police departments which is not credited as service as a member under Section 8.584 shall count under this section upon transfer of a member of either of such departments to employment entitling him to membership in the Retirement System under Section 8.584, provided that the accumulated contributions standing to the credit of such member shall be adjusted by refund to the member or by payment by the member to bring the account at the time of such transfer to the amount which would have been credited to it had the member been a miscellaneous member throughout the period of his service in either of such departments at the compensation he received in such departments. 
	(c)	Time prior to November 2, 1976, during which said member was entitled to receive compensation while a miscellaneous member under any other section of the Charter, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service previously refunded are redeposited with interest from the date of refund to the date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the retirement board. 
	(d)	Prior service determined and credited as prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for persons who are members under Section 8.507. 
	(e)	The Board of Supervisors, by ordinance enacted by a three-fourths vote of its members, may provide for the crediting as service, rendered as an employee of the federal government and service rendered as an employee of the State of California or any public entity or public agency in the State of California. Said ordinance shall provide that all contributions required as the result of the crediting of such service shall be made by the member and that no contributions therefor shall be required of the City and County. 
	(f)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsections (a) or (b) next preceding which is not deemed absence from service under the provisions of Section 8.520 of the Charter and for which such member is entitled to receive credit as service for the City and County by virtue of contributions made in accordance with the provisions of such section. 
A8.584-8  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for members under Section 8.584 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section 8.584 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member under Section 8.584, or shall be paid to said member or his estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections 8.584-5 and 8.584-6. 
	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section 8.584-8, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section 8.584. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section 8.584, said percentage to be the ratio of the value on November 2, 1976, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid to or on account of members under Section 8.584 from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said system to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after said date, to the value at said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be made every odd-numbered year. 
	(c)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section 8.584 shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. 
A8.584-9  RIGHT TO RETIRE
	Upon the completion of the years of service set forth in Section 8.584-2 as requisite to retirement, a member shall be entitled to retire at any time thereafter in accordance with the provisions of said Section 8.584-2, and, except as provided in Section 8.584-13, nothing shall deprive said member of said right.

	(b)	(1)	Service as an election officer or juror, or in the preparation for or giving testimony as an expert witness for or on behalf of the City and County before any court or legislative body shall not be affected by the provisions of Subsection (a) of this section. 
		(2)	The provisions of Subsection (a) shall not prevent such retired person from serving on any board or commission of the City and County and receiving the compensation for such office, provided said compensation does not exceed $100 per month. 
		(3)	If such retired person is elected or appointed to a position or office which subjects him to membership in the Retirement System under Section 8.584, he shall re-enter membership under Section 8.584 and his retirement allowance shall be cancelled immediately upon such re-entry. The provisions of Subsection (a) of this section shall not prevent such person from receiving the compensation for such position or office. The rate of contribution of such member shall be the same as that for other members under Section 8.584. Such member's individual account shall be credited with an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of his annuity at the time of his re-entry, but the amount thereof shall not exceed the amount of his accumulated contributions at the time of his retirement. Such member shall also receive credit for his service as it was at the time of his retirement. 
	(c)	Notwithstanding any provision of this Charter to the contrary, should any person retired for service or disability engage in a gainful occupation prior to attaining the age of 60 years, the retirement board shall reduce that part of his monthly retirement allowance which is provided by contributions of the City and County to an amount which, when added to the amount of the compensation earnable, at the time he engages in the gainful occupation, by such person if he held the position which he held at the time of his retirement, or, if that position has been abolished, the compensation earnable by the member if he held the position from which he was retired immediately prior to its abolishment. 
A8.584-11  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES

If, at the date of retirement for service, or retirement for disability resulting from an injury received in performance of duty, said member has no spouse, children or dependent parents, who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance after the death of said member, or with respect to the portion of the allowance which would not be continued regardless of dependents, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, with respect to all of the allowance and regardless of dependents at retirement, a member retired under this section, or Section 8.585-3, may elect before the first payment of the retirement allowance is made, to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her allowance or the portion which would not be continued regardless of dependents, as the case may be, partly in a lesser allowance to be received by him or her throughout his or her life, and partly in other benefits payable after his or her death to another person or persons, provided that such election shall be subject to all the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar election by other members of the Retirement System, including the character and amount of such other benefits. 
A8.585-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the fire department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by performance of his duty, shall be retired. If he is not qualified for service retirement, he shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.585-1, as his percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.585-1. Said allowance shall be paid to him until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section 8.585-1, he would have received immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance, shall not be less than 55 percent of such final compensation. 
	If at the time of retirement because of disability, he is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section 8.585-2, he shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he would receive if retired under Section 8.585-2, but not less than 55 percent of said final compensation. Any member of the fire department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his duty, by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.585-10, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1½ percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section 8.585-1 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 331/3 percent of said final compensation; provided, however, that if such member has completed at least 25 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.585-10, but has not yet attained the age of 50 years, he shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance he would have received if he had attained the age of 50 years and retired under Section 8.585-2 as of the date of retirement for such incapacity. The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the fire commission, or by said member or his guardian. If his disability shall cease, his retirement allowance shall cease, and he shall be restored to the service in the rank he occupied at the time of his retirement. 
A8.585-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the fire department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his surviving wife throughout her life or until her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he had been retired for service on the day of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the final compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement, had he lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he would have received immediately prior to said date, had he lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such monthly final compensation. If he had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he was a member under Section 8.585 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be reduced upon the date at which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been reduced had the member not died. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents dependent upon him for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving widow otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife following the death of a member unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
A8.585-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the fire department resulting from any cause, other than an injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if his death occurred after qualification for service retirement, under Section 8.585-2, or after retirement for service or because of disability which resulted from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he had retired for service at the time of death of three-fourths of the retirement allowance as it was at his death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout life or until marriage, to his surviving wife, or 
	(b)	if his death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, three-fourths of the retirement allowance to which he would have been entitled under Section 8.585-2 if he had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife, or 
	(c)	if his death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, his retirement allowance as it was at his death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date of which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.585-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section 8.585-3 if he had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty resulting from a cause other than bodily injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood, or a parent or parents dependent upon him for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving wife otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he had not retired, or unless she was married to the member at least one year prior to his death if he had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section 8.585-4, "surviving wife" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving wife, in the event of death of the member after qualification for but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section 8.585-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to her under this section. If there be no surviving wife, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there be no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "Qualification for service retirement" or "Qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section 8.585 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section 8.585-10. 
A8.585-6  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES
	Every retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of any member under Section 5.585 shall be increased or decreased as of July 1, 1990, and thereafter on the effective date of any legislation fixing the rates of compensation for firefighters under section 8.405 of this Charter by an amount equal to 50 percent of any increase or decrease, respectively, in the rate of remuneration attached to the rank and position upon which such retirement or death allowance was based; provided, however, that no allowance shall be reduced below the amount being received by a member or his beneficiary on June 30, 1976, or on the date such member or beneficiary began to receive the allowance, whichever is later. 
A8.585-7  ADJUSTMENT FOR COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the fire department which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced in the manner fixed by the Board of Supervisors, by the amount of any benefits other than medical benefits, payable by the City and County to or on account of such person, under any workers' compensation law or any other general law and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
A8.585-8  DEATH BENEFIT
	If a member of the fire department shall die, before retirement from causes other than an injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, or regardless of cause, if no allowance shall be payable under Section 8.585-4 or 8.585-5 preceding, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his estate or designated beneficiary the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. 
A8.585-9  REFUNDS AND REDEPOSITS
	Should any member of the fire department cease to be employed as such a member, through any cause other than death or retirement or transfer to another office or department, all of his or her contributions, with interest credited thereon, shall be refunded to him or her subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar terminations of employment of other members of the Retirement System. If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund, the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the fire department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change, equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the fire department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues. 
A8.585-10  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the Fire Department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time, the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his service while he was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon re-entry into service: 
	(a)	Time during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a member of the fire or police department. 
	(b)	Time during which said member is entitled to receive compensation while a member of the Retirement System, because of service rendered in other offices and departments prior to July 1, 1949, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service previously refunded, are redeposited, with interest from date of refund to date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the retirement board; and solely for purpose of determining qualification for retirement under Section 8.585-3 for disability not resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, time during which said member serves, after July 1, 1949, and receives compensation because of services rendered in other offices and departments. 
	(c)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsections (a) and (b) next preceding, by reason of service in the Armed Forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his account. 
	(d)	Time during which said member was on Unpaid Parental Leave pursuant to Charter Section A8.523, and for which said member has purchased service credit in the Retirement System. 
(Amended by Proposition G, 11/4/2008)
A8.585-11  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for members under Section A8.585 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	The normal rate of contribution for each member under Section A8.585 shall be made from funds based on his or her age taken to the next lower complete quarter year, (1) at the date he or she became a member under Section A8.568, in the case of persons who are members under that section, or (2) on his or her age at the date he or she becomes a member under Section A8.585 in the case of persons who become members on or after July 1, 1975, without credit for service counted under Section A8.585-10. The age of entrance into the fire department shall be determined by deducting the member's service credited under Section A8.585-10 as rendered prior to the date upon which his or her age is based for determination of his or her rate of contribution according to the sentence next preceding, from said age. The normal rate of contribution of each such member, to be effective from the effective date of membership under Section A8.585, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption, under Section A8.585-2, one-third of that portion of the service retirement allowance to which he or she would be entitled, without continuance to dependents, upon first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, which is based on service rendered after the date upon which his or her age is based for determination of his or her rate of contribution according to the first sentence in this paragraph, and assuming the contribution to be made from that date. The normal rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed seven percent.
	(b)	The dependent contributions for each member under this section which shall be required of each member throughout his or her membership in addition to the normal contributions, and in the same manner as normal contributions, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption under Section A8.585-2, and upon his first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, one-third of the portion of his or her allowance, which is to be continued under Section A8.585-5 after his or her death and throughout the life of a surviving spouse whose age at said death is three years less than the age of said member. If, at the date of retirement for service or retirement for disability resulting from injury received in performance of duty, said member has no spouse who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance to them after the death of said member, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, regardless of his or her marital conditions, the dependent contributions with accumulated interest thereon, shall be paid to him or her forthwith. The dependent rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed the difference between seven percent and the member's normal rate of contribution, and said dependent rate may be taken as a flat percentage of the member's normal rate, regardless of the age of qualification for service retirement.
	(c)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under this Section, a sum determined by applying the member's rates of contribution to such compensation payment. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his or her estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections A8.585-5, A8.585-6 and A8.585-8. The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest.
	(d)	Contributions based on time included in Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section A8.585-10, and deducted prior to July 1, 1975, from compensation of persons who become members under Section A8.585, and standing with interest thereon, to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, together with contributions made by such members pursuant to the provisions of Section A8.526 and standing with interest thereon to the credit of such members on the records of the Retirement System on said date, shall continue to be credited to the individual accounts of said members and shall be combined with and administered in the same manner as the contributions deducted after said date. 
	(e)	The total contributions, with interest thereon, made by or charged against the City and County and standing to its credit, in the accounts of the Retirement System, on account of persons who become members under Section A8.585, shall be applied to provide the benefits under said Section A8.585. 
	(f)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Section A8.585-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.585. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by each member prior to the date upon which his or her age is based for determination of his or her rate of contribution in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.585-11, shall not be less during any fiscal year than the amount of such benefits paid during said year. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder which shall be based on service rendered by respective members on and after the date stated in the preceding sentence, shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year, to persons who are members under Section A8.585, said percentage to be the ratio of the value on July 1, 1975, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid under this Section, from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, and plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said systems to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after the date stated in the sentence next preceding, to the value of said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be every odd-numbered year. 
	(g)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section A8.585-11 or this Charter, beginning on July 1, 2012, the employee contribution rate set forth in Subsection (a) for each member, shall be increased or decreased each fiscal year based on the employer contribution rate for that fiscal year calculated by the Retirement System's actuary as prescribed in Subsection (f). Said increase or decrease in the employee contribution rate shall be calculated as a percentage of compensation, as set forth below:
Employer Contribution RateChange In Member Contribution0%-6.0%.01%-1.0%-5.0%1.01%-2.5%-4.75%2.51%-4.0%-4.5%4.01%-5.5%-3.5%5.51%-7.0%-3.0%7.01%-8.5%-2.0%8.51%-10.0%-1.5%10.01%-11.0%-0.5%11.01%-12.0%0%12.01%-13.0%0.5%13.01%-15.0%1.5%15.01%-17.5%2.0%17.51%-20.0%3.0%20.01%-22.5%3.5%22.51%-25.0%4.5%25.01%-27.5%4.5%27.51%-30.0%4.75%30.01%-32.5%4.75%32.51%-35.0%5.0%Over 35.0%6.0%		The employee contribution increases shall be deducted from each payment of compensation and shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said additional contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member under Section A8.585, or shall be paid to said member or his or her beneficiary or estate as provided in Sections A8.585-4, A8.585-5, and A8.585-8.
		The percentage increase in member contributions shall reduce, by a corresponding percentage, the City and County contributions to the Retirement System otherwise required for that fiscal year.
		The employee contribution decreases shall be paid by the City and County at the time each member is paid compensation, such that the Retirement System receives from the member and the City and County combined, a sum equal to seven percent of the member's compensation as provided in Subsection (a). The sums so received shall be credited to the individual accounts of the member on whose behalf the contributions are made.
		The percentage increase in contributions by the City and County shall be in addition to the contributions required by the City and County under Subsection (f) for that fiscal year.
	(h)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies the contributions of both members of the City and County held by the system to provide the benefits under this Section, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. Nothing in this Section shall affect the obligations of the City and County to pay to the Retirement System any amounts which may or shall become due under the provisions of the Charter prior to July 1, 1975, and which are represented on said effective date, in the accounts of said system by debits against the City and County.
	(i)	The Retirement Board's authority under Charter Sections 12.100 and A8.500 and in Section A8.510 concerning the annual setting of the rates of contribution is not subject to the meet and confer process, including the procedures under Section A8.590 et seq.
(Amended by Proposition G, 11/4/2008; Proposition C, Approved 11/8/2011)
A8.585-12  RIGHT TO RETIRE
	Upon the completion of the years of service set forth in Section 8.585-2 as requisite to retirement, a member of the fire department shall be entitled to retire at any time thereafter in accordance with the provisions of said Section 8.585-2, and nothing shall deprive said member of said right. 
A8.585-13  LIMITATION IN EMPLOYMENT DURING RETIREMENT
	Except as otherwise provided in section 8.511 of this Charter, no person retired as a member under Section 8.585 for service or disability and entitled to receive a retirement allowance under the Retirement System shall serve in any elective or appointive position in the City and County service, including membership on boards and commissions, nor shall such person receive any payment for service rendered to the City and County after retirement, provided that service as an election officer or juror, or in the preparation for, or the giving of, testimony as an expert witness for or on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco before any court or legislative body shall not be affected by this section. 
A8.585-14  RIGHT TO TRANSFER
	Notwithstanding any provisions of this Charter to the contrary, any person who, on or after January 1, 1981, is a member of the Fire Department, and is a member of the Retirement System under Charter Section 8.585, may become a member of the Retirement System under Charter Section 8.588 by filing in writing with the Retirement System no later than December 31, 1981, an executed waiver of all benefits which might inure to him under Charter Section 8.585. This waiver must be without right of revocation and on a form furnished by the Retirement System. The Retirement Board may require that this waiver be executed by additional parties before it becomes operative. 
	This transfer will be effective July 1, 1980. Those persons so electing to become members under Charter Section 8.588 shall receive service credit under Charter Section 8.588 equal to their service credit under Charter Section 8.585 as of June 30, 1980. 
	Those persons so electing to become members under Charter Section 8.588 shall not be subject to any of those provisions of Charter Section 8.585 as of July 1, 1980. 
	Notwithstanding the provisions of Charter Section 8.526, the cost of living adjustment in any given year prior to January 1, 2000 for those persons electing this transfer to Charter Section 8.588 shall not exceed the provisions of Charter Section 8.526 as they existed on July 1, 1980. 
	Those persons so electing to transfer membership from Charter Section 8.585 to Charter Section 8.588 shall receive a monetary consideration not to exceed $40,000 calculated at the rate of $2,500 for each year of said service credit up to 10 years and then at the rate of $1,000 for each additional year of said service credit. This monetary consideration shall be paid from said member's contribution account including any interest thereon. When said member's contribution account is depleted, the balance shall be paid from the City and County contributions held by the Retirement System. 
	This consideration shall be payable January 1, 1982. Alternatively, an employee may elect to receive payments according to a schedule established by the Retirement Board. 
	Notwithstanding any other Charter or ordinance provisions, a member transferring pursuant to this section shall be eligible to receive any benefits payable because of an increase in benefits approved by the voters for other members under Charter Section 8.588, provided, however, that said member repays with interest the monetary consideration he or she received in making this transfer, offset by the amount of said member's own account in the Retirement System under Charter Section 8.585. Interest on the repayment amount shall be charged at the rate credited to member accounts from January 1, 1981 until repayment or effective date of retirement. Members shall have the option of making said repayment either through a lump-sum payment, payroll deduction or through an actuarial offset against any benefits payable because of any increase in benefits subsequent to July 1, 1980. 
	The amendments to this section contained in the proposition submitted to the electorate on November 2, 1999 shall apply only to active and retired members on November 2, 1999 and constitute a prospective increase in benefits to such members subject to repayment in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph. Upon repayment, retirees shall have their benefits recalculated under Charter Section 8.588 as in force at the date of their retirement. These recalculated benefits shall be first payable on and after November 2, 1999. No retired member shall become eligible under said amendments for any retroactive payments. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the provisions in Charter Section 8.588-3 for recalculation on the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement ("QSR") shall use the provisions of Charter Section 8.588 at QSR. 
(Amended November 1999)
A8.585-15  VESTING
	Should any member of the fire department who is a member of the Retirement System under Charter section 8.585, with five years of credited service, cease to be so employed, through any cause other than death or retirement, he or she shall have the right to elect, without right of revocation and within 90 days after termination of said service, to allow his or her accumulated contributions including interest to remain in the retirement fund and to receive a retirement benefit calculated at termination, defined as that proportion of the normal service retirement benefit that his or her accrued service credit bears to 25 years, payable beginning at age 50. 
	Any member of the fire department convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed in connection with his or her duties as a member of the fire department shall, upon termination of his or her employment pursuant to the provisions of this Charter, forfeit all right to any benefits under this section except refund of his or her accumulated contributions. 
	Every retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of any member under section 8.585-15 shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of section 8.585-6 provided that if the member's accrued service credit is less than 25 years the section 8.585-6 adjustment will be multiplied by a fraction where the denominator is 25 and the numerator is equal to the member's accrued service credit at the date of termination. 
A8.585-16  SEVERABILITY
	Any Section or part of any Section in this Charter, insofar as it should conflict with the provisions of Section A8.585 or with any part thereof, shall be superseded by the contents of Section A8.585. Section A8.585 shall be interpreted to be consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections, provisions or portions of Section A8.585 are held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a final judgment of a court, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections, provisions or portions of Section A8.585. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, subsections, provisions or portions of Section A8.585 are held invalid as applied to any person, circumstance, employee or category of employee, such invalidity shall not affect any application of Section A8.585 which can be given effect. Section A8.585 shall be broadly construed to achieve its stated purposes.

A8.586-1  DEFINITIONS
	The following words and phrases as used in this section, Section 8.586 and Sections 8.586-2 through 8.586-14, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, shall have the following meanings: 
	"Retirement allowance," "death allowance" or "allowance," shall mean equal monthly payments, beginning to accrue upon the date of retirement, or upon the day following the date of death, as the case may be, and continuing for life unless a different term of payment is definitely provided by the context.

	Subject to the requirement that it be payable in cash and that overtime be excluded, "compensation" for pension purposes may be defined in a collective bargaining agreement. Provided, however, that for retirement purposes, any increase in compensation attached to a rank which is based solely upon the possession of a POST certificate, compared to the equivalent rank without a POST certificate, shall be subject to the following limitations: 
	(a)	for possession of the intermediate POST certificate, no more than 4% shall be included in compensation,
	(b)	for possession of the advanced POST certificate, no more than an additional 2% over the maximum provided in subsection (a), above, shall be included in compensation, 
	These limits shall apply to any pay increments which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate, including but not limited to premiums or special ranks which may be established in the future and which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate. 
	"Compensation earnable" shall mean the compensation which would have been earned had the member received compensation without interruption throughout the period under consideration and at the rates of remuneration attached at that time to the ranks or positions held by him or her during such period, it being assumed that during any absence, he or she was in the rank or position held by him or her at the beginning of the absence, and that prior to becoming a member of the police department, he or she was in the rank or position first held by him or her in such department. 
	"Benefit" shall include "allowance," "retirement allowance," "death allowance" and "death benefit." 
	"Final compensation" shall mean the average monthly compensation earnable by a member during any one year of credited service in which his or her average compensation is the highest. 
	For purposes of calculation of final compensation, any increase in pay solely attributable to possession of a POST certificate shall be included only if the member possesses the qualifying POST certificate for a period of not less than four (4) years prior to his or her retirement date; provided, however, that should a member possess the qualifying POST certificate for a period of time less than four (4) years prior to retirement, final compensation shall be calculated based upon the monthly compensation in the next lower rank not requiring possession of the qualifying POST certificate. 
	For the purpose of Sections 8.586 through 8.586-14, the terms "member of the police department," "member of the department," or "member" shall mean any officer or employee of the police department employed after November 1, 1976 who was or shall be subject to the Charter provisions governing entrance requirements of members of the uniformed force of said department and said terms shall further mean persons employed after November 1, 1976 at an age not greater than the maximum age then prescribed for entrance into employment in said uniformed force, to perform duties now performed under the titles of criminologist, photographer, police woman or jail matron; provided, however, that said terms shall not include any person who has not satisfactorily completed such course of training as may be required by the police department prior to assignment to active duty with said department.

A member retired after meeting the service and age requirements in the sentence next preceding, shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the larger of (a) two percent of final compensation for each of the first twenty-five (25) years of service, then three percent of final compensation for each year of service rendered in excess of twenty-five (25) years or (b) the percent of final compensation (as defined in Section 8.586-1) set forth opposite his or her age at retirement, taken to the preceding completed quarter year, for each year of service, as computed under Section 8.586-10:

A8.586-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his or her duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, shall be retired. If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.586-1, as his percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.586-1. Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section 8.586-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section 8.586-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section 8.586-2, but not less than 50 percent of said final compensation. Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his or her duty by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.586-10, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1½ percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section 8.586-1 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 331/3 percent of said final compensation. The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the police commission or by said member or his or her guardian. If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease and he or she shall be restored to the service in the rank he or she occupied at the time of his or her retirement. 
(Amended November 1998)
A8.586-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the police department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section 8.586 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there be no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
	The amendments to this Section A8.586-4, approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall apply to any work-related death that occurs on or after November 2, 2004, and to any qualified survivor who, on November 2, 2004, is receiving a continuation allowance under this section due to the work-related death of a member on or after January 1, 1989. Any increase in the continuation allowance payable to such a qualified survivor by virtue of the amendments to this section approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall be prospective only, beginning November 2, 2004. 
(Amended November 1998; November 2004)
A8.586-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the police department resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if the death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Section 8.586-2, or after retirement service or because of disability which result from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service at the date of death or one-half of the retirement allowance as it was at his or her death, as the case may be, shall be continued through out his or her life or until remarriage to his surviving wife, or 
	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section 8.586-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.586-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section 8.586-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his surviving wife. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving wife otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section 8.556-4 "surviving wife" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving wife, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section 8.586-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to her under this section. If there be no surviving wife, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there be no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section 8.586 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section 8.586-10. 
(Amended November 1998)
A8.586-6  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
(Amended November 1998)
A8.586-8  DEATH BENEFIT
	If a member of the police department shall die, before retirement from causes other than an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, or regardless of cause if no allowance shall be payable under Section 8.586-4 or 8.586-5 preceding, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. 
(Amended November 1998)
A8.586-9  REFUNDS AND REDEPOSITS

If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the police department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the police department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues.

	(c)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsection (a) next preceding, by reason of service in the Armed Forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his or her account.

	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section 8.586 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his or her estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections 8.586-8, 8.586-9 and 8.586-10. The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest. 
	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section 8.586-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section 8.586. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section 8.586, said percentage to the ratio of the value on November 2, 1976, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid to or on account of members under Section 8.586 from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said system to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after said date, to the value on said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be made every odd-numbered year. 
	(c)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section 8.586, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included.

The provisions of Subsection (a) of this section shall not prevent such person from receiving the compensation for such position or office. The rate of contributions of such member shall be the same as that for other members under Section 8.586. Such member's individual account shall be credited with an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of his or her annuity at the time of his or her re-entry, but the amount thereof shall not exceed the amount of his or her accumulated contributions at the time of his or her retirement. Such member shall also receive credit for his or her service as it was at the time of his or her retirement.

A8.587-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member who becomes incapacitated for performance of duty because of disability determined by a qualified hearing officer to be of extended and uncertain duration, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service credited in the Retirement System in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.587-7, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1.8% (one and eight-tenths percent) percent of the average final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.587-1 for each year of credited service, if such retirement allowance exceeds 40 percent of his or her average final compensation; otherwise 1.8% (one and eight-tenths percent) percent of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of City service which would be credited to him or her were such City service to continue until attainment by him or her of age 60, but such retirement allowance shall not exceed 40 percent of such average final compensation. In the calculation under this section of the retirement allowance of a member having credit for service in a position in the evening schools and service in any other position, separate retirement allowances shall be calculated, in the manner prescribed, for each class of service, the average final compensation in each case being that for the respective class of service; provided that the average final compensation upon which the minimum total retirement allowance is calculated in such case shall be based on the compensation earnable by the member in the classes of service rendered by him or her during the one year immediately preceding his or her retirement. Part-time service and compensation shall be converted to full-time service and compensation in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, and when so converted shall be applied as full-time service and compensation in the calculation of retirement allowances. The question of retiring members under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by the retirement board's executive director on its behalf, by said member, by his or her department head or by his or her guardian.

		(2)	If a member sustains a traumatic bodily injury through external and violent means in the course and scope of employment and death results within 180 days of such injury, an additional insurance benefit of 12 months of compensation earnable shall be paid to the member's estate or designated beneficiary. 
	(b)	If, at the date of his or her death, he or she was qualified for service retirement by reason of service and age under the provisions of Section A8.587-2, and he or she has designated as beneficiary his or her surviving spouse, who was married to him or her for at least one full year immediately prior to the date of his or her death, one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service on the date of his or her death shall be paid to such surviving spouse who was his or her designated beneficiary at the date of his or her death, until such spouse's death or remarriage, or if there be no surviving spouse, to the unmarried child or children of such member under the age of 18 years, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If, at the death of such surviving spouse, who was receiving an allowance under this Subsection (b), there be one or more unmarried children of such member under the age of 18 years, such allowance shall continue to such child or children, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subsection (b) is less than the benefit which was otherwise payable under Subsection (a) of this section, the amount of said benefit payable under Subsection (a) less an amount equal to the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subsection (b) shall be paid in a lump sum as follows:

If a surviving spouse, who was entitled to make the election herein provided, shall die before or after making such election but before receiving any payment pursuant to such election, then the legally appointed guardian of the unmarried children of the member under the age of 18 years may make the election herein provided before any benefit has been paid under this section, for and on behalf of such children if in his or her judgment it appears to be in their interest and advantage, and the election so made shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties in interest. 
	If any person other than such surviving spouse shall have and be paid a community property interest in any portion of any benefit provided under this section, any allowance payable under this Subsection (b) shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent, at the date of the member's death, of the amount of benefits paid to such other person. 
	Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members.

No allowance, however, shall be paid under this paragraph to a surviving spouse unless such surviving spouse was married to said member at least one year prior to his or her retirement. If such retired person leaves no such surviving spouse, or if such surviving spouse should die or remarry before every child of such deceased retired person attains the age of 18 years, the allowance which such surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to retired person's child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.

A8.588-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the fire department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his or her duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, shall be retired. If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.585-1, as his percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section 8.585-1. Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section 8.588-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than fifty percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section 8.588-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section 8.588-2, but not less than 50 percent of said final compensation. Any member of the fire department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his or her duty by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.588-10, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1½ percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section 8.588-1 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 331/3 percent of said final compensation. The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the fire commission or by said member or his or her guardian. If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease and he or she shall be restored to the service in the rank he occupied at the time of his or her retirement. 
(Amended November 1996)
A8.588-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the fire department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section 8.588 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there be no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
	The amendments to this Section A8.588-4, approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall apply to any work-related death that occurs on or after November 2, 2004, and to any qualified survivor who, on November 2, 2004, is receiving a continuation allowance under this section due to the work-related death of a member on or after January 1, 1989. Any increase in the continuation allowance payable to such a qualified survivor by virtue of the amendments to this section approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall be prospective only, beginning November 2, 2004. 
(Amended November 1996; November 2004)
A8.588-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the fire department resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if the death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Section 8.588-2, or after retirement service or because of disability which result from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service at the date of death or one-half of the retirement allowance as it was at his death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout his or her life or until remarriage, to his or her surviving wife, or 
	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section 8.588-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife, or

	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section 8.588-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section 8.588-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage, to his surviving wife. If there be no surviving wife entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving wife would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving wife and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving wife otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this section to a surviving wife unless she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section 8.588-4 "surviving wife" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving wife, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section 8.588-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to her under this section. If there be no surviving wife, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there be no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section 8.588 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section 8.588-10. 
(Amended November 1996)
A8.588-6  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES

A8.588-7  ADJUSTMENT FOR COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the fire department which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced in the manner fixed by the Board of Supervisors, by the amount of any benefits other than medical benefits, payable by the City and County to or on account of such person, under any workers' compensation law or any other general law and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
A8.588-8  DEATH BENEFIT
	If a member of the fire department shall die, before retirement from causes other than an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, or regardless of cause if no allowance shall be payable under Section 8.588-4 or 8.588-5 preceding, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System.

If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the fire department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the fire department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues. 
A8.588-10  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the fire department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time, the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his or her service while he or she was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon re-entry into service:

	(c)	Time during which said member earned compensation as a paramedic with the department of public health, provided that the accumulated contributions on account of such service are transferred to his or her 8.588 account or, if previously refunded, are redeposited with interest from the date of refund to the date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the retirement board. The retirement board shall require that a waiver be executed by said member so that any paramedic service covered by Section 8.588 is not also covered by other pension provisions in this Charter. 
	(d)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsection (a) next preceding, by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Section 8.520 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his or her account.

	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section 8.588 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the board of supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his or her estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections 8.588-8, 8.588-9 and 8.588-10. The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest. 
	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section 8.588-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section 8.588. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section 8.588, said percentage to the ratio of the value on November 2, 1976, or at the later date of a periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system, of the benefits thereafter to be paid to or on account of members under Section 8.588 from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said system to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after said date, to the value on said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. Said actuarial valuation shall be made every even-numbered year and said investigation into the experience under the system shall be made every odd-numbered year. 
	(c)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section 8.588, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included.

The Arbitration Board shall decide each issue by majority vote by selecting whichever last offer of settlement on that issue it finds most nearly conforms to those factors traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of public and private employment, including, but not limited to: changes in the average consumer price index for goods and services; the wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of employment of employees performing similar services; the wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of other employees in the City and County of San Francisco; and the formulas provided for in this Charter for the establishment and maintenance of wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of employment. The impartial Arbitration Board shall also consider the financial condition of the City and County of San Francisco and its ability to meet the costs of the decision of the Arbitration Board. 
	(e)	After reaching a decision, the Arbitration Board shall mail or otherwise deliver a true copy of its decision to the parties. The decision of the Arbitration Board shall not be publicly disclosed and shall not be binding until ten (10) days after it is delivered to the parties. During that ten (10) day period the parties shall meet privately, attempt to resolve their differences, and by mutual agreement amend or modify the decision of the Arbitration Board. At the conclusion of the ten (10) day period, which may be extended by mutual agreement between the parties, the decision of the Arbitration Board, as it may be modified or amended by the parties, shall be publicly disclosed. Except as limited by Section A8.590-7, the arbitration decision, as it may be modified or amended by the parties, shall supersede any and all other relevant formulas, procedures and provisions of this Charter relating to wages, hours, benefits and terms and conditions of employment; and it shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute, including the City and County of San Francisco, its commissions, departments, officers and employees. No other actions or procedural steps to confirm or approve the decision of the Arbitration Board shall be permitted or required; provided, however, that the City and County of San Francisco, its designated officers, employees and representatives and the recognized employee organization involved in the dispute shall take whatever action that is necessary to carry out and effectuate the decision of the Arbitration Board. 
	(f)	The expenses of any arbitration proceedings convened pursuant to these Charter sections, including the fee for the services of the chairperson of the Arbitration Board, the costs of preparation of the transcript of the proceedings and other costs related to the conduct of the proceedings, as determined by the Arbitration Board, shall be borne equally by the parties. All other expenses which the parties may incur are to be borne by the party incurring such expenses. 
	(g)	The impasse resolution procedures set forth in Section A8.590-5 shall not apply to:
		1.	any dispute or controversy concerning the San Francisco Police Department's crowd control policies;
		2.	any procedures or practices relating to the processing and disposition of complaints handled by the Office of Citizens' Complaints; or matters relating to disciplinary procedures that apply to disciplinary actions involving members of the San Francisco Police Department and Fire Department covered by these sections; or matters covered by Charter section A8.343; and 
		3.	any rule, policy, procedure, order or practice which relates or pertains to the purpose, goals or requirements of a consent decree, or which is necessary to ensure compliance with Federal, State or local anti-discrimination laws, ordinances or regulations. 
		In the event the City acts on a matter it has determined relates to or pertains to a consent decree, or in the event the City acts to ensure compliance with Federal, State, or local anti-discrimination laws, ordinances or regulations, and the affected employee organization disputes said determination, that determination or action shall not be subject to arbitration. 
	(h)	An agreement reached between the designated representatives for the City and the representatives of a recognized employee organization that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors on or before May 15, or a decision of the Arbitration Board that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors on or before May 10, or May 15 if the parties waive the 10-day period between the Board's decision and public disclosure of the decision, shall be effective on July 1 of the same calendar year upon adoption by the Board of Supervisors. An agreement submitted to the Board of Supervisors after May 15, or a decision of the Arbitration Board that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors after May 10, or May 15 if the parties waive the 10-day period between the Board's decision and public disclosure of the decision, shall become effective no earlier than July 1 of the next calendar year upon approval of the Board of Supervisors. But an agreement reached during the term of an existing memorandum of understanding that results in a net reduction, or results in no net increase, in the cost to the City, during the current fiscal year, of existing economic provisions in the existing memorandum of understanding may become effective at any time upon approval by the Board of Supervisors. Economic provisions include, but are not limited to, wages, premium pay rates, overtime, any employer pickup of the employees' retirement contribution, paid time off, and other compensation.

A8.590-6  RETIREE BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS
	No agreement reached by the parties and no decision of the arbitration board shall reduce the vested retirement benefits of retirees or employees of the fire department, police department or of the sheriff department. Retirement and death allowances shall continue to be set and adjusted pursuant to Chapter Five of this Article, except that the amount to which said allowances are set and adjusted for uniformed employees of the police department and fire department shall not be less than the amount said allowances would be if the salaries of the uniformed forces in the police and fire departments continued to be set pursuant to Charter Section 8.405. Any agreement or decision of the arbitration board altering vested retirement benefits shall be subject to the written approval of the individual beneficiaries thereof. 
(Amended March 2004)
A8.590-7  PRESERVATION OF TAX BENEFITS
	(a)	Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-7, in their entirety, shall be subject to and limited by Charter section A8.500 and any ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-7 shall be effective only to the extent that benefits authorized by or authorized pursuant to those sections do not have an adverse consequence on the tax treatment of benefits provided to any employee of the City and County. 
	(b)	Any agreement reached by the parties or any decision of the arbitration board which authorizes a modification of any aspect of the Retirement System or of any aspect of the provision for or delivery of retirement benefits shall not become effective until the following occur: 
		(1)	The retirement board, acting in its fiduciary capacity, forwards to the Board of Supervisors certification that implementation of the modifications presents no risk to the tax-qualified status of the Retirement System. Such certification shall be based upon the advice of the general manager, the actuary of the Retirement System, and any outside consultants that they may in their discretion retain; and, 
		(2)	After having received the certification referred to in the previous paragraph and after having made its own independent finding based on clear and convincing evidence that implementation of the modifications presents no risk to the tax-qualified status of the Retirement System and will not increase the taxes of City and County employees, the Board of Supervisors, by a three-quarters vote, enacts an ordinance making the modifications effective. 
	(c)	Costs of any outside consultants retained by the City and County pursuant to this section shall be borne equally by the City and County and by the bargaining units concerned.

A8.590-8  RETIREE HEALTH CARE TRUST FUND.
	Notwithstanding any other provision of Charter Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-7, the provisions and operation of the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund, including employee contributions to the fund, shall be determined pursuant to Charter Sections 12.204 and A8.432, and shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedure's contained in Charter Section A8.590-5. Nothing in this section shall prevent the City and County of San Francisco and a recognized employee organization from agreeing to, or an arbitration panel formed pursuant to A8.590-5 from awarding, an adjustment in employee contributions into the Retiree Health Care Trust Fund that results in contributions greater than the contributions required under A8.432 for any and all City employees. In no event shall the City and County of San Francisco and a recognized employee organization agree to, or an arbitration panel formed pursuant to A8.590-5 award any, reduction in contributions below the minimum level of contributions required under A8.432.

A8.590-9  EMPLOYEES NOT IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
	It is the intent of the voters that officers and employees of the City and County of San Francisco who are not members of the San Francisco Employees' Retirement System negotiate cost-sharing provisions that produce comparable savings and costs to the City and County as are produced through the Charter's employee contribution rate adjustment formulae. Notwithstanding any other provision of Charter Sections A8.590-1 through A8.590-8, for any officer or employee who is not a member of the Retirement System, the parties in any proceeding under Section A8.590-5 may make proposals, to the extent allowable by law, to effect this principle of equitable participation. If no agreement on this issue is reached, in deciding whichever last offer of settlement should be selected, in addition to the other factors specified by Section A8.590-5, the Arbitration Board shall consider (i) the additional amounts such officers and employees would pay to the Retirement System, or the reduction in the rate of their employee contribution which would apply, if they were members of the Retirement System for the term of the agreement; and (ii) the cost of the City and County's contracts with the Public Employees' Retirement System of the State of California compared to the cost of providing retirement benefits for similarly situated officers and employees through the San Francisco Employees' Retirement System.
	Charter Section A8.590-9 shall be interpreted to be consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or provisions of Charter Section A8.590-9 are held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a final judgment of a court, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or provisions of Charter Sections A8.590-9. If any words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or provisions of Charter Section A8.590-9 are held invalid as applied to any person, circumstance, employee or category of employee, such invalidity shall not affect any application of Charter Section A8.590-9 which can be given effect. Charter Section A8.590-9 shall be broadly construed to achieve its stated purpose.

A8.595-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his or her duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, shall be retired. If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.595-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.595-1. Said allowance shall be paid to said member until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by the member at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section A8.595-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section A8.595-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section A8.595-2, but not less than 55 percent of said final compensation.

The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the police commission, or by said member or his or her guardian. If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease, and he or she shall be restored to the service in the rank he or she occupied at the time of his or her retirement.

A8.595-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the police department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the day of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the final compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by the member at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such monthly final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section 5.595 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be reduced upon the date at which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been reduced had the member not died. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, three-fourths of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.595-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse; or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date of which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died; or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.595-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.595-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty resulting from a cause other than bodily injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her death if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section A8.595-4, "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.595-A8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "Qualification for service retirement" or "Qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section A8.595 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section A8.595-10.

A8.595-6  ADJUSTMENT OF ALLOWANCES
	Every retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of any member under Section A8.595 shall be increased or decreased as of January 1, 2003, and thereafter on the effective date of any legislation fixing the rates of compensation for police officers under section A8.590-1 et seq. of this Charter by an amount equal to 50 percent of any increase or decrease, respectively, in the rate of remuneration attached to the rank or position upon which such retirement or death allowance was based; provided, however, that no allowance shall be reduced below the amount being received by a member or his or her beneficiary on January 1, 2003, or on the date such member or beneficiary began to receive the allowance, whichever is later.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

Should a member of the police department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change, equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the police department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues.

A8.595-11  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for members under Section A8.595 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.595 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the board of supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System. shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his or her estate or beneficiary as provided in Section A8.595-4, A8.595-5 and A8.595-8. 
	(b)	The dependent contributions of each member under this Section which shall be required of each member throughout his or her membership in addition to the normal contributions, and in the same manner as normal contributions, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption under Section A8.595-2, and upon he or she first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, one-third of the portion of his or her allowance, which is to be continued under Section A8.595-5 after his or her death and throughout the life of a surviving spouse whose age at said death is three years less than the age of said member. If, at the date of retirement for service or retirement for disability resulting from injury received in the performance of duty, said member has no spouse who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance to him or her after the death of said member, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, regardless of his or her marital conditions, the dependent contributions with accumulated interest thereon, shall be paid to him or her forthwith. The dependent rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed the difference between seven percent and the member's normal rate of contribution, and said dependent rate may be taken as a flat percentage of the member's normal rate, regardless of the age of qualification for service retirement. 
	(c)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.595-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.595. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section A8.595 in accordance with the provisions of Section A8.510. 
	(d)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section A8.595, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. 
	(e)	Any year in which, based upon the Retirement System's annual actuarial valuation, the employer contribution rate exceeds 0%, the employee organizations representing safety members shall jointly meet and confer with City representatives to implement a cost sharing arrangement between the City and employee organizations. Such arrangement will effect a material reduction of the cost impact of employer contributions on the City's general fund. 
		The dollar value of the cost sharing arrangement shall not exceed the total annual cost to the Retirement System of improving the police and fire safety retirement plans to the 3% @ 55 benefit level or the total employer contribution required by the Retirement System, whichever is lesser. Such cost sharing arrangement shall not require an employee contribution in excess of the limits set elsewhere in this Charter. 
		The meet and confer process, including all impasse procedures under Section A8.590-1 et seq., shall be concluded not later than April 1st except by mutual agreement of the parties. The cost sharing arrangement must be finalized to permit implementation effective July 1. 
	(f)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section A8.595-11 or this Charter, beginning on July 1, 2012, the employee contribution rate set forth in Subsection (a) shall be increased or decreased each fiscal year based on the employer contribution rate for that fiscal year calculated by the Retirement System's actuary as prescribed in Subsection (c). Said increase or decrease in the employee contribution rate shall be calculated as a percentage of compensation, as set forth below:
Employer Contribution RateChange In Member Contribution0%-6.0%.01%-1.0%-5.0%1.01%-2.5%-4.75%2.51%-4.0%-4.5%4.01%-5.5%-3.5%5.51%-7.0%-3.0%7.01%-8.5%-2.0%8.51%-10.0%-1.5%10.01%-11.0%-0.5%11.01%-12.0%0%12.01%-13.0%0.5%13.01%-15.0%1.5%15.01%-17.5%2.0%17.51%-20.0%3.0%20.01%-22.5%3.5%22.51%-25.0%4.5%25.01%-27.5%4.5%27.51%-30.0%4.75%30.01%-32.5%4.75%32.51%-35.0%5.0%Over 35.0%6.0%
		The employee contribution increases shall be deducted from each payment of compensation and shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said additional contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member under Section A8.595, or shall be paid to said member or his or her beneficiary or estate as provided in Sections A8.595-4, A8.595-5 and A8.595-8.
		The percentage increase in member contributions shall reduce, by a corresponding percentage, the City and County contributions to the Retirement System on account of said member otherwise required for that fiscal year.
		The employee contribution decreases shall be paid by the City and County at the time each member is paid compensation, such that the Retirement System receives from the member and the City and County combined, a sum equal to seven percent of the member's compensation as provided in Subsection (a). The sums so received shall be credited to the individual accounts of the member on whose behalf the contributions are made.
		The percentage increase in contributions by the City and County shall be in addition to the contributions required by the City and County under Subsection (c) for that fiscal year.
	(g)	The Retirement Board's authority under Charter Sections 12.100 and A8.500 and in Section A8.510 concerning the annual setting of the rates of contribution is not subject to the meet and confer process, including the impasse procedures under Sections A8.590 et seq.

If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.596-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.596-1.

If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the day of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the final compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have qualified for service retirement, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by the member at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 55 percent of such monthly final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section 5.596 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be reduced upon the date at which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been reduced had the member not died. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, three-fourths of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.596-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse; or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage, to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date of which said member would have qualified for service retirement, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died; or

	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her death if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section A8.596-4, "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.596-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "Qualification for service retirement" or "Qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section A8.596 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section A8.596-10.

(Added November 2002)
A8.596-7  ADJUSTMENT FOR COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the fire department which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced, by the amount of any benefits other than medical benefits, payable by the City and County to or on account of such person, under any workers' compensation law or any other general law and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
(Added November 2002)
A8.596-8  DEATH BENEFIT

If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund, the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the fire department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change, equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the fire department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues. 
(Added November 2002)
A8.596-10  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the fire department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time, the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his or her service while he or she was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon reentry into service: 
	(a)	Time during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a member of the police or fire department.

A8.596-11  SOURCES OF FUNDS
	All payments provided for members under Section A8.596 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.596 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the board of supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his or her estate or beneficiary as provided in Section A8.596-4, A8.596-5 and A8.596-8. 
	(b)	The dependent contributions of each member under this Section which shall be required of each member throughout his or her membership in addition to the normal contributions, and in the same manner as normal contributions, shall be such as, on the average for such member, will provide, assuming service without interruption under Section A8.596-2, and upon he or she first qualifying as to age and service for retirement under that section, one-third of the portion of his or her allowance, which is to be continued under Section A8.596-5 after his or her death and throughout the life of a surviving spouse whose age at said death is three years less than the age of said member. If, at the date of retirement for service or retirement for disability resulting from injury received in the performance of duty, said member has no spouse who would qualify for the continuance of the allowance to him or her after the death of said member, or upon retirement for disability resulting from other causes, regardless of his or her marital conditions, the dependent contributions with accumulated interest thereon, shall be paid to him or her forthwith. The dependent rate of contribution, however, shall not exceed the difference between seven percent and the member's normal rate of contribution, and said dependent rate may be taken as a flat percentage of the member's normal rate, regardless of the age of qualification for service retirement. 
	(c)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.596-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.596. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section A8.596 in accordance with the provisions of Section A8.510. 
	(d)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section A8.596, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. 
	(e)	Any year in which, based upon the Retirement System's annual actuarial valuation, the employer contribution rate exceeds 0%, the employee organizations representing safety members shall jointly meet and confer with City representatives to implement a cost sharing arrangement between the City and employee organizations. Such arrangement will effect a material reduction of the cost impact of employer contributions on the City's general fund. 
		The dollar value of the cost sharing arrangement shall not exceed the total annual cost to the Retirement System of improving the police and fire safety retirement plans to the 3% @ 55 benefit level or the total employer contribution required by the Retirement System, whichever is lesser. Such cost sharing arrangement shall not require an employee contribution in excess of the limits set elsewhere in this Charter. 
		The meet and confer process, including all impasse procedures under section A8.590-1 et seq., shall be concluded not later than April 1st except by mutual agreement of the parties. The cost sharing arrangement must be finalized to permit implementation effective July 1. 
	(f)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section A8.596-11 or this Charter, beginning on July 1, 2012, the employee contribution rate set forth in Subsection (a) shall be increased or decreased each fiscal year based on the employer contribution rate for that fiscal year calculated by the Retirement System's actuary as prescribed in Subsection (c). Said increase or decrease in the employee contribution rate shall be calculated as a percentage of compensation, as set forth below:
Employer Contribution RateChange In Member Contribution0%-6.0%.01%-1.0%-5.0%1.01%-2.5%-4.75%2.51%-4.0%-4.5%4.01%-5.5%-3.5%5.51%-7.0%-3.0%7.01%-8.5%-2.0%8.51%-10.0%-1.5%10.01%-11.0%-0.5%11.01%-12.0%0%12.01%-13.0%0.5%13.01%-15.0%1.5%15.01%-17.5%2.0%17.51%-20.0%3.0%20.01%-22.5%3.5%22.51%-25.0%4.5%25.01%-27.5%4.5%27.51%-30.0%4.75%30.01%-32.5%4.75%32.51%-35.0%5.0%Over 35.0%6.0%
		The employee contribution increases shall be deducted from each payment of compensation and shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said additional contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of, said member under Section A8.596, or shall be paid to said member or his or her beneficiary or estate as provided in Sections A8.596-4, A8.596-5 and A8.596-8.
		The percentage increase in member contributions shall reduce, by a corresponding percentage, the City and County contributions to the Retirement System on account of said member otherwise required for that fiscal year.
		The employee contribution decreases shall be paid by the City and County at the time each member is paid compensation, such that the Retirement System receives from the member and the City and County combined, a sum equal to seven percent of the member's compensation as provided in Subsection (a). The sums so received shall be credited to the individual accounts of the member on whose behalf the contributions are made.
		The percentage increase in contributions by the City and County shall be in addition to the contributions required by the City and County under Subsection (c) for that fiscal year.
	(g)	The Retirement Board's authority under Charter Sections 12.100 and A8.500 and in Section A8.510 concerning the annual setting of the rates of contribution is not subject to the meet and confer process, including the impasse procedures under Section A8.590 et seq.

	Every retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of any member under Section A8.596-14 shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section A8.596-6 provided that if the member's accrued service credit is less than 25 years the Section A8.596-6 adjustment will be multiplied by a fraction where the denominator is 25 and the numerator is equal to the member's accrued service credit at the date of termination.

A8.596-15  SEVERABILITY
	Any Section or part of any Section in this Charter, insofar as it should conflict with the provisions of Section A8.596 or with any part thereof shall be superseded by the contents of Section A8.596. Section A8.596 shall be interpreted to be consistent with all federal and state laws, rules, and regulations.

	Subject to the requirement that it be payable in cash and that overtime be excluded, "compensation" for pension purposes may be defined in a collective bargaining agreement. Provided, however, that for retirement purposes, any increase in compensation attached to a rank which is based solely upon the possession of a POST certificate, compared to the equivalent rank without a POST certificate, shall be subject to the following limitations: 
	(a)	for possession of the intermediate POST certificate, no more than 4% shall be included in compensation,
	(b)	for possession of the advanced POST certificate, no more than an additional 2% over the maximum provided in subsection (a), above, shall be included in compensation, These limits shall apply to any pay increments which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate, including but not limited to premiums or special ranks which may be established in the future and which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate. 
	"Compensation earnable" shall mean the compensation which would have been earned had the member received compensation without interruption throughout the period under consideration and at the rates of remuneration attached at that time to the ranks or positions held by him or her during such period, it being assumed that during any absence, he or she was in the rank or position held by him or her at the beginning of the absence, and that prior to becoming a member of the police department, he or she was in the rank or position first held by him or her in such department.

	For purposes of calculation of final compensation, any increase in pay solely attributable to possession of a POST certificate shall be included only if the member possesses the qualifying POST certificate for a period of not less than four (4) years prior to his or her retirement date; provided, however, that should a member possess the qualifying POST certificate for a period of time less than four (4) years prior to retirement, final compensation shall be calculated based upon the monthly compensation in the next lower rank not requiring possession of the qualifying POST certificate. 
	For the purpose of Section A8.597 through A8.597-14, the terms "member of the police department," "member of the department," or "member" shall mean any member of the police department on January 1, 2003 who was an active member of the Retirement System under Section A8.586, and any officer or employee of the police department employed after January 1, 2003 who was or shall be subject to the Charter provisions governing entrance requirements of members of the uniformed force of said department and said terms shall further mean persons employed after January 1, 2003 at an age not greater than the maximum age then prescribed for entrance into employment in said uniformed force, to perform duties now performed under the titles of criminologist, photographer, police woman or jail matron; provided, however, that said terms shall not include any person who has not satisfactorily completed such course of training as may be required by the police department prior to assignment to active duty with said department.

A member retired after meeting the service and age requirements in the preceding sentence, shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the percent of final compensation (as defined in Section A8.597-1) set forth below opposite his or her age at retirement, taken to the preceding completed quarter year, for each year of service, as computed under Section A8.597-10:

If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.597-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the retirement board for that purpose; provided that the retirement board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.597-1. Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section A8.597-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section A8.597-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section A8.597-2, but not less than 50 percent of said final compensation. Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his or her duty by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.597-10, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1½ percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section A8.597-1 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 331/3 percent of said final compensation. The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the retirement board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the police commission or by said member or his or her guardian.

If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.597 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
	The amendments to this Section A8.597-4, approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall apply to any work-related death that occurs on or after November 2, 2004, and to any qualified survivor who, on November 2, 2004, is receiving a continuation allowance under this section due to the work-related death of a member on or after January 1, 1989. Any increase in the continuation allowance payable to such a qualified survivor by virtue of the amendments to this section approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall be prospective only, beginning November 2, 2004.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.597-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or

If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section A8.597-4 "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.597-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section A8.597 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section A8.597-10.

Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System.

Members of the police department on November 6, 2007, who are members of the Retirement System under Section A8.597 shall execute and file said waiver on or before February 1, 2008. Failure to file a timely waiver shall bar any application to have such airport police officer service treated as safety service under this subsection.

	(d)	Any year in which, based upon the Retirement System's annual actuarial valuation, the employer contribution rate exceeds 0%, the employee organizations representing safety members shall jointly meet and confer with City representatives to implement a cost sharing arrangement between the City and employee organizations.

Such cost sharing arrangement shall not require an employee contribution in excess of the limits set elsewhere in this Charter. 
		The meet and confer process, including all impasse procedures under section A8.590-1 et seq., shall be concluded not later than April 1st except by mutual agreement of the parties. The cost sharing arrangement must be finalized to permit implementation effective July 1.

		The employee contribution increases shall be deducted from each payment of compensation and shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said additional contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member under Section A8.597, or shall be paid to said member or his or her beneficiary or estate as provided in Sections A8.597-4, A8.597-4 and A8.597-8.
		The percentage increase in member contributions shall reduce, by a corresponding percentage, the City and County contributions to the Retirement System on account of said member otherwise required for that fiscal year.
		The employee contribution decreases shall be paid by the City and County at the time each member is paid compensation, such that the Retirement System receives from the member and the City and County combined, a sum equal to seven percent of the member's compensation as provided in Subsection (a). The sums so received shall be credited to the individual accounts of the member on whose behalf the contributions are made.
		Said contributions by the City and County shall be in addition to the contributions required by the City and County under Subsection (b) for that fiscal year.
	(f)	The Retirement Board's authority under Charter Sections 12.100 and A8.500 and in Section A8.510 concerning the annual setting of the rates of contribution is not subject to the meet and confer process, including the impasse procedures under Sections A8.590 et seq.

	If a member of the fire department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.598 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
	The amendments to this Section A8.597-4, approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall apply to any work-related death that occurs on or after November 2, 2004, and to any qualified survivor who, on November 2, 2004, is receiving a continuation allowance under this section due to the work-related death of a member on or after January 1, 1989. Any increase in the continuation allowance payable to such a qualified survivor by virtue of the amendments to this section approved by the electorate on November 2, 2004 shall be prospective only, beginning November 2, 2004.

A8.598-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the fire department resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if the death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Section A8.598-2, or after retirement service or because of disability which result from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service at the date of death or one-half of the retirement allowance as it was at his or her death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout his or her life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.598-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.598-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.598-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section A8.598-4 "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.598-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section A8.598 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section A8.598-10.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.598-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.598.

	(d)	Any year in which, based upon the Retirement System's annual actuarial valuation, the employer contribution rate exceeds 0%, the employee organizations representing safety members shall jointly meet and confer with City representatives to implement a cost sharing arrangement between the City and employee organizations.

	In no event shall a member's retirement allowance exceed seventy-five percent of his or her average final compensation. 
	Before the first payment of a retirement allowance is made, a member, retired under this section or Section A8.600-3, may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her allowance, partly in an allowance to be received by him or her throughout his or her life, and partly in other benefits payable after his or her death to another person or persons, provided that such election shall be subject to all the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors to govern similar elections by other members of the Retirement System, including the character and amount, of such other benefits. In the calculations under this section of the retirement allowance of a member having credit for service in a position in the evening schools and service in any other position, separate retirement allowances shall be calculated, in the manner prescribed for each class of service, the average final compensation in each case being that for the respective class of service, provided that the aggregate retirement allowance shall be taken into account in applying the provisions of this section providing for a minimum retirement allowance. Part-time service and compensation shall be converted to full-time service and compensation in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors, and when so converted shall be applied on full-time service and compensation in the calculation of retirement allowances.

A8.600-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member who becomes incapacitated for performance of duty because of disability determined by a qualified hearing officer to be of extended and uncertain duration, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service credited in the Retirement System in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.600-7, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1.8% (one and eight-tenths percent) of the average final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.600-1 for each year of credited service, if such retirement allowance exceeds 40 percent of his or her average final compensation; otherwise 1.8% (one and eight-tenths percent) of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of years of City service which would be credited to him or her were such City service to continue until attainment by him or her of age 60, but such retirement allowance shall not exceed 40 percent of such average final compensation. In the calculation under this section of the retirement allowance of a member having credit for service in a position in the evening schools and service in any other position, separate retirement allowances shall be calculated, in the manner prescribed, for each class of service, the average final compensation in each case being that for the respective class of service; provided that the average final compensation upon which the retirement allowance is calculated in such case shall be based on the compensation earned by the member in the classes of service rendered by him or her during the two years immediately preceding his or her retirement. The question of retiring members under this section may be brought before the Retirement Board on said Board's own motion, by the Retirement Board's Executive Director on its behalf, by said member, by his or her department head or by his or her guardian.

	If a member shall die, before retirement: 
	(a)	If no benefit is payable under subsection (b) of this section:
		(1)	Regardless of cause, a death benefit shall be paid to the member's designated beneficiary or estate consisting of the compensation earnable by the member during the six months immediately preceding death, plus the member's contributions and interest credited thereon. 
		(2)	If a member sustains a traumatic bodily injury through external and violent means in the course and scope of employment and death results within 180 days of such injury, an additional insurance benefit of 12 months of compensation earnable shall be paid to the member's designated beneficiary or estate. 
	(b)	If, at the date of his or her death, he or she was qualified for service retirement by reason of service and age under the provisions of Section A8.600-2, and he or she has designated as beneficiary his or her surviving spouse, who was married to him or her for at least one full year immediately prior to the date of his or her death, one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service on the date of his or her death shall be paid to such surviving spouse who was his or her designated beneficiary at the date of his or her death, until such spouse's death or remarriage, or if there be no surviving spouse, to the unmarried child or children of such member under the age of 18 years, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If, at the death of such surviving spouse, who was receiving an allowance under this Subsection (b), there be one or more unmarried children of such member under the age of 18 years, such allowance shall continue to such child or children, collectively, until every such child dies, marries or attains the age of 18 years, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subsection (b) is less than the benefit which was otherwise payable under Subsection (a) of this section, the amount of said benefit payable under Subsection (a) less an amount equal to the total of the payments of allowance made pursuant to this Subsection (b) shall be paid in a lump sum as follows: 
		(1)	If the person last entitled to said allowance is the remarried surviving spouse of such member, to such spouse.
		(2)	Otherwise, to the surviving children of the member, share and share alike, or if there are no such children, to the estate of the person last entitled to said allowance. 
		The surviving spouse may elect, on a form provided by the Retirement System and filed in the office of the Retirement System before the first payment of the allowance provided herein, to receive the benefit provided in Subsection (a) of this section in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be payable under the provisions of this subdivision. If a surviving spouse, who was entitled to make the election herein provided, shall die before or after making such election but before receiving any payment pursuant to such election, then the legally appointed guardian of the unmarried children of the member under the age of 18 years may make the election herein provided before any benefit has been paid under this section, for and on behalf of such children if in his or her judgment it appears to be in their interest and advantage, and the election so made shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties in interest. 
		If any person other than such surviving spouse shall have and be paid a community property interest in any portion of any benefit provided under this section, any allowance payable under this Subsection (b) shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent, at the date of the member's death, of the amount of benefits payable to such other person. 
		Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her designated beneficiary or estate in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
		Upon the death of a member after retirement, an allowance, in addition to the death benefit provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, shall be paid to his or her surviving spouse, until such surviving spouse's death or remarriage, equal to one-half of his or her retirement allowance as it was prior to optional modification and prior to reduction as provided in Subsection (a) of Section A8.514 of this Charter, but exclusive of the part of such allowance which was provided by additional contributions. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this paragraph to a surviving spouse unless such surviving spouse was married to said member at least one year immediately prior to his or her retirement. If such retired person leaves no such surviving spouse, or if such surviving spouse should die or remarry before every child of such deceased retired person attains the age of 18 years, the allowance which such surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to retired person's child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.

Failure to make such election shall be deemed an irrevocable election to withdraw his or her accumulated contributions. At or after 50 years of age, he or she shall be entitled to receive a retirement allowance which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his or her accumulated contributions and an equal amount of the contributions of the City and County, plus 1.667% (one and two-thirds percent) of his or her average final compensation for each year of service credited to him or her as rendered prior to his or her first membership in the Retirement System.

	(a)	Time during which said member is a member of the Retirement System under Section A8.600, and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a miscellaneous officer or employee. 
	(b)	Service in the fire and police departments which is not credited as service as a member under Section A8.600 shall count under this section upon transfer of a member of either of such departments to employment entitling him or her to membership in the Retirement System under Section A8.600, provided that the accumulated contributions standing to the credit of such member shall be adjusted by refund to the member or by payment by the member to bring the account at the time of such transfer to the amount which would have been credited to it had the member been a miscellaneous member throughout the period of his or her service in either of such departments at the compensation he or she received in such departments. 
	(c)	Prior service, during which said member was entitled to receive compensation while a miscellaneous member under any other section of the Charter, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service previously refunded are redeposited with interest from the date of refund to the date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the Retirement Board. 
	(d)	Prior service determined and credited as prescribed by the Board of Supervisors.
	(e)	The Board of Supervisors, by ordinance enacted by a three-fourths vote of its members, may provide for the crediting as service in the Retirement System, service rendered as an employee of the federal government and service rendered as an employee of the State of California or any public entity or public agency in the State of California. Said ordinance shall provide that all contributions required as the result of the crediting of such service shall be made by the member and that no contributions therefore shall be required of the City and County. 
	(f)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsections (a) or (b) and for which such member is entitled to receive credit as service for the City and County by virtue of contributions made in accordance with the provisions of Section A8.520 or Section A8.521 of the Charter.

	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.600 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member under Section A8.600, or shall be paid to said member or his or her estate or beneficiary as provided in Sections A8.600-5 and A8.600-6. The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest. 
	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.600-8, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.600. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section A8.600, said percentage to be the ratio of the value as of the latest periodical actuarial valuation of the benefits thereafter to be paid to or on account of members under Section A8.600 from contributions of the City and County, less the amount of such contributions, plus accumulated interest thereon, then held by said system to provide said benefits on account of service rendered by respective members after said date, to the value at said respective dates of salaries thereafter payable to said members. Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation by all causes, of members from service before retirement and of death after retirement. The base rate of pay shall be adjusted each fiscal year by the percentage increase in the cost of living during the previous calendar year, as shown by the then current CPI-U Index, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but not to exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%). Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system.

If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.601-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be.

A8.601-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the fire department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.601 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death. 
(Added by Proposition D, Approved 6/8/2010)
A8.601-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the fire department resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if the death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Section A8.601-2, or after retirement service or because of disability which result from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service at the date of death or one-half of the retirement allowance as it was at his or her death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout his or her life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.601-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.601-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.601-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section A8.601-4 "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.601-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section A8.601 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section A8.601-10.

A8.601-7  ADJUSTMENT FOR COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
	That portion of any allowance payable because of the death or retirement of any member of the fire department which is provided by contributions of the City and County, shall be reduced, by the amount of any benefits other than medical benefits, payable by the City and County to or on account of such person, under any workers' compensation law or any other general law and because of the injury or illness resulting in said death or retirement. Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits. 
(Added by Proposition D, Approved 6/8/2010)

Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her designated beneficiary or estate, the amount of which and the conditions for the payment of which shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the death benefit of other members of the Retirement System.

If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the fire department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the fire department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues.

A8.601-10  COMPUTATION OF SERVICE
	The following time shall be included in the computation of the service to be credited to a member of the fire department for the purposes of determining whether such member qualified for retirement and calculating benefits, excluding, however, any time, the contributions for which were withdrawn by said member upon termination of his or her service while he or she was a member under any other Charter section, and not redeposited upon re-entry into service: 
	(a)	Time during and for which said member is entitled to receive compensation because of services as a member of the police or fire department. 
	(b)	Time prior to July 1, 2010, during which said member was entitled to receive compensation while a member of the police or fire department under any other section of the Charter, provided that accumulated contributions on account of such service previously refunded are redeposited with interest from the date of refund to the date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the Retirement Board; and solely for the purpose of determining qualification for retirement under Section A8.601-3 for disability not resulting from injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, time during which said member serves and receives compensation because of services rendered in other offices and departments. 
	(c)	Time during which said member earned compensation as a paramedic with the fire department or department of public health, provided that the accumulated contributions on account of such service are transferred to his or her Section A8.601 account or, if previously refunded, are redeposited with interest from the date of refund to the date of redeposit, at times and in the manner fixed by the Retirement Board. The Retirement Board shall require said member to execute a waiver at any time prior to retirement so that any paramedic service covered by Section A8.601 is not also covered by other pension provisions in this Charter. 
	(d)	Time during which said member is absent from a status included in Subsection (a) next preceding, by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States of America, or by reason of any other service included in Sections A8.520 and A8.521 of the Charter, during any war in which the United States was or shall be engaged or during other national emergency, and for which said member contributed or contributes to the Retirement System or for which the City and County contributed or contributes on his or her account.

	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.601 a sum equal to eight and one-half percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. The eight and one-half percent member contribution rate shall take effect immediately upon expiration of the agreement that is operative on June 30, 2010, between the City and County and the recognized bargaining organization representing said members. Prior to that time, there shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.601 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation.

	(c)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section A8.601, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. 
	(d)	Any year in which, based upon the Retirement System's annual actuarial valuation, the employer contribution rate exceeds 0%, the employee organizations representing safety members shall jointly meet and confer with City representatives to implement a cost sharing arrangement between the City and employee organizations. Such arrangement will effect a material reduction of the cost impact of employer contributions on the City's general fund. 
		The dollar value of the cost sharing arrangement shall not exceed the total annual cost to the Retirement System of improving the police and fire safety retirement plans to the 3% @ 55 benefit level or the total employer contribution required by the Retirement System, whichever is lesser. Such cost sharing arrangement shall not require an employee contribution in excess of the limits set elsewhere in this Charter. 
		The meet and confer process, including all impasse procedures under Section A8.590-1 et seq., shall be concluded not later than April 1st except by mutual agreement of the parties. The cost sharing arrangement must be finalized to permit implementation effective July 1.

	"Retirement allowance," "death allowance" or "allowance," shall mean equal monthly payments, beginning to accrue upon the date of retirement, or upon the day following the date of death, as the case may be, and continuing for life unless a different term of payment is definitely provided by the context.

	Subject to the requirement that it be payable in cash and that overtime be excluded, "compensation" for pension purposes may be defined in a collective bargaining agreement. Provided, however, that for retirement purposes, any increase in compensation attached to a rank which is based solely upon the possession of a POST certificate, compared to the equivalent rank without a POST certificate, shall be subject to the following limitations: 
	(a)	for possession of the intermediate POST certificate, no more than 4% shall be included in compensation,
	(b)	for possession of the advanced POST certificate, no more than an additional 2% over the maximum provided in Subsection (a), above, shall be included in compensation, These limits shall apply to any pay increments which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate, including but not limited to premiums or special ranks which may be established in the future and which are solely attributable to the possession of a POST certificate. 
	"Compensation earnable" shall mean the compensation which would have been earned had the member received compensation without interruption throughout the period under consideration and at the rates of remuneration attached at that time to the ranks or positions held by him or her during such period, it being assumed that during any absence, he or she was in the rank or position held by him or her at the beginning of the absence, and that prior to becoming a member of the police department, he or she was in the rank or position first held by him or her in such department.

	For purposes of calculation of final compensation, any increase in pay solely attributable to possession of a POST certificate shall be included only if the member possesses the qualifying POST certificate for a period of not less than four (4) years prior to his or her retirement date; provided, however, that should a member possess the qualifying POST certificate for a period of time less than four (4) years prior to retirement, final compensation shall be calculated based upon the monthly compensation in the next lower rank not requiring possession of the qualifying POST certificate. 
	For the purpose of Sections A8.602 through A8.602-16, the terms "member of the police department," "member of the department," or "member" shall mean any officer or employee of the police department employed on and after July 1, 2010, who was or shall be subject to the Charter provisions governing entrance requirements of members of the uniformed force of said department and said terms shall further mean persons employed on and after July 1, 2010, at an age not greater than the maximum age then prescribed for entrance into employment in said uniformed force, to perform duties now performed under the titles of criminologist, photographer, police woman or jail matron; provided, however, that said terms shall not include any person who has not satisfactorily completed such course of training as may be required by the police department prior to assignment to active duty with said department.

A member retired after meeting the service and age requirements in the preceding sentence, shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the percent of final compensation (as defined in Section A8.602-1) set forth below opposite his or her age at retirement, taken to the preceding completed quarter year, for each year of service, as computed under Section A8.602-10:

A8.602-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the police department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his or her duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, shall be retired. If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.602-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be. The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the Retirement Board for that purpose; provided that the Retirement Board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.602-1. Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section A8.602-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section A8.602-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section A8.602-2, but not less than 50 percent of said final compensation.

The question of retiring a member under this section may be brought before the Retirement Board on said board's own motion, by recommendation of the police commission or by said member or his or her guardian. If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease and he or she shall be restored to the service in the rank he or she occupied at the time of his or her retirement.

A8.602-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the police department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.602 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

A8.602-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the police department resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if the death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Section A8.602-2, or after retirement service or because of disability which result from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service at the date of death or one-half of the retirement allowance as it was at his or her death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout his or her life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.602-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.602-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.602-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this section and Section A8.602-4 "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.602-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election. "Qualified for service retirement," "qualification for service retirement" or "qualified as to age and service for retirement," as used in this section and other sections to which persons who are members under Section A8.602 are subject, shall mean completion of 25 years of service and attainment of age 50, said service to be computed under Section A8.602-10.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

If he or she shall again become a member of the department, he or she shall redeposit in the retirement fund the amount refunded to him or her. Should a member of the police department become an employee of any other office or department, his or her accumulated contribution account shall be adjusted by payments to or from him or her as the case may be to make the accumulated contributions credited to him or her at the time of change equal to the amount which would have been credited to him or her if he or she had been employed in said other office or department at the rate of compensation received by him or her in the police department and he or she shall receive credit for service for which said contributions were made, according to the Charter section under which his or her membership in the Retirement System continues.

	All payments provided for members under Section A8.602 shall be made from funds derived from the following sources, plus interest earned on said funds: 
	(a)	There shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.602 a sum equal to eight and one-half percent of such payment of compensation. The sum so deducted shall be paid forthwith to the Retirement System. The eight and one-half percent member contribution rate shall take effect immediately upon expiration of the agreement that is operative on June 30, 2010, between the City and County and the recognized bargaining organization representing said members. Prior to that time, there shall be deducted from each payment of compensation made to a member under Section A8.602 a sum equal to seven percent of such payment of compensation. Said contribution shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose salary it was deducted, and the total of said contributions, together with interest credited thereon in the same manner as is prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for crediting interest to contributions of other members of the Retirement System, shall be applied to provide part of the retirement allowance granted to, or allowance granted on account of said member, or shall be paid to said member or his or her beneficiary or as provided in Sections A8.602-8, A8.602-9 and A8.602-10. 
	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.602-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.602. Such contributions of the City and County to provide the portion of the benefits hereunder shall be made in annual installments, and the installment to be paid in any year shall be determined by the application of a percentage to the total compensation paid during said year to persons who are members under Section A8.602 in accordance with the provisions of Section A8.510. 
	(c)	To promote the stability of the Retirement System through a joint participation in the result of variations in the experience under mortality, investment and other contingencies, the contributions of both members and the City and County held by the system to provide benefits for members under Section A8.602, shall be a part of the fund in which all other assets of said system are included. 
	(d)	Any year in which, based upon the Retirement System's annual actuarial valuation, the employer contribution rate exceeds 0%, the employee organizations representing safety members shall jointly meet and confer with City representatives to implement a cost sharing arrangement between the City and employee organizations. Such arrangement will effect a material reduction of the cost impact of employer contributions on the City's general fund. 
		The dollar value of the cost sharing arrangement shall not exceed the total annual cost to the Retirement System of improving the police and fire safety retirement plans to the 3% @ 55 benefit level or the total employer contribution required by the Retirement System, whichever is lesser. Such cost sharing arrangement shall not require an employee contribution in excess of the limits set elsewhere in this Charter. 
		The meet and confer process, including all impasse procedures under Section A8.590-1 et seq., shall be concluded not later than April 1st except by mutual agreement of the parties. The cost sharing arrangement must be finalized to permit implementation effective July 1. 
	(e)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section A8.602-11 or this Charter, beginning on July 1, 2012, the employee contribution rate set forth in Subsection (a) for each member with a base rate of pay less than $48.00 per hour shall be increased or decreased each fiscal year based on the employer contribution rate for that fiscal year calculated by the Retirement System's actuary as prescribed in Subsection (b). The base rate of pay shall be adjusted each fiscal year by the percentage increase in the cost of living during the previous calendar year, as shown by the then current CPI-U Index, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but not to exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%). Said increase or decrease in the employee contribution rate shall be calculated as a percentage of compensation, as set forth below:

If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.604 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

A8.604-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a member of the fire department resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty,

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.604-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.604-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.604-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this Section and Section A8.604-4 "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.604-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.605 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.605-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or

If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	As used in this Section and Section A8.605-4 "surviving spouse" shall mean and include a surviving spouse, and shall also mean and include a spouse who has remarried since the death of the member, but whose remarriage has been terminated by death, divorce or annulment within five years after the date of such remarriage and who has not thereafter again remarried. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.605-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.606 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.606-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.606-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.606-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.606-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

The individual accounts of members who purchased service credit for Unpaid Parental Leave shall also include the amount paid by the member for said purchase, plus interest. 
	(b)	The City and County shall contribute to the Retirement System such amounts as may be necessary, when added to the contributions referred to in Subsection (a) of this Section A8.606-11, to provide the benefits payable to members under Section A8.606.

If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation.  If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.607 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.  Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.  No allowance, however, shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.607-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.6076-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.607-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse.  If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.  Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children, under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.  No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.607-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section.  If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

A8.608-3  RETIREMENT FOR INCAPACITY
	Any member of the sheriff's department who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his or her duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, shall be retired.  If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.608-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be.  The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the Retirement Board for that purpose; provided that the Retirement Board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.608-1.  Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the position held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section A8.608-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section A8.608-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section A8.608-2, but not less than 50 percent of said final compensation.  Any member of the sheriff's department who becomes incapacitated for performance of his or her duty by reason of a cause not included under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentences, and who shall have completed at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.608-10, shall be retired upon an allowance of 1½ percent of the final compensation of said member as defined in Section A8.608-1 for each year of service, provided that said allowance shall not be less than 331/3 percent of said final compensation.  The question of retiring a member under this Section may be brought before the Retirement Board on said Board's own motion, by the Retirement Board's Executive Director on its behalf, by recommendation of the sheriff's department, or by said member, or his or her guardian.  If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease and he or she shall be restored to the service in the position he or she occupied at the time of his or her retirement.

A8.608-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a member of the sheriff's department shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage.  If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death.  If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the position held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation.  If he or she had retired prior to death, for service or for disability resulting from injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance of the member, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.608 and retirement was for such disability, and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. 
	If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.  Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.  No allowance, however, shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.608-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, three-fourths of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.608-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.608-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse.  If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.  Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.  No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.608-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section.  If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

	Any miscellaneous safety member who becomes incapacitated for the performance of his or her duty by reason of any bodily injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, shall be retired. If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.6098-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be.

Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the position held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section A8.609-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation.

A8.609-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a miscellaneous safety member  shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage. If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death. If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the position held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. 
	If he or she had retired prior to death, the allowance payable shall be equal to one-half of his or her retirement allowance of the member as it was prior to optional modification and prior to reduction as provided in Subsection (a) of Section A8.514 of this Charter, but exclusive of the part of such allowance which was provided by additional contributions, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.609 and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. If such retired person leaves no such surviving spouse, or if such surviving spouse should die or remarry before every child of such deceased retired person attains the age of 18 years, the allowance which such surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to retired person's child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. 
	Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
	No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death, or unless such surviving spouse was married to said member at least one year prior to his or her retirement. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.

A8.609-5  PAYMENT TO SURVIVING DEPENDENTS
	Upon the death of a miscellaneous safety member  resulting from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, 
	(a)	if the death occurred after qualification for service retirement under Section A8.609-2, or after retirement for service or because of disability which result from any cause other than an injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty one-half of the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired for service at the date of death or one-half of the retirement allowance as it was at his or her death, as the case may be, shall be continued throughout his or her life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.609-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, one-half of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.609-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.609-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency. No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. 
	The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.609-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section. If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

If he or she is not qualified for service retirement, he or she shall receive a retirement allowance in an amount which shall be equal to the same percentage of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.610-1, as his or her percentage of disability is determined to be.  The percentage of disability shall be as determined by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board of the State of California upon referral from the Retirement Board for that purpose; provided that the Retirement Board may, by five affirmative votes, adjust the percentage of disability as determined by said appeals board; and provided, further, that such retirement allowance shall be in an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 90 percent of the final compensation of said member, as defined in Section A8.610-1.  Said allowance shall be paid to him or her until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the rank held by him or her at retirement, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date based on the final compensation, as defined in Section A8.610-1, he or she would have received immediately prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation. 
	If, at the time of retirement because of disability, he or she is qualified as to age and service for retirement under Section A8.610-2, he or she shall receive an allowance equal to the retirement allowance which he or she would receive if retired under Section A8.610-2, but not less than 50 percent of said final compensation.

The question of retiring a member under this Section may be brought before the Retirement Board on said Board's own motion, by the Retirement Board's Executive Director on its behalf, by recommendation of the miscellaneous safety member's department, or by said member, or his or her guardian.  If his or her disability shall cease, his or her retirement allowance shall cease and he or she shall be restored to the service in the position he or she occupied at the time of his or her retirement.

A8.610-4  DEATH ALLOWANCE
	If a miscellaneous safety member shall die before or after retirement by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of his or her duty, a death allowance, in lieu of any allowance, payable under any other section of the Charter or by ordinance, on account of death resulting from injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, shall be paid, beginning on the date next following the date of death, to his or her surviving spouse throughout his or her life or until his or her remarriage.  If the member, at the time of death, was qualified for service retirement, but he or she had not retired, the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance which the member would have received if he or she had been retired for service on the date of death, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of the final compensation earnable by said member immediately preceding death.  If death occurs prior to qualification for service retirement, the allowance payable shall be equal to the compensation of said member at the date of death, until the date upon which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, had he or she lived and rendered service without interruption in the position held by him or her at death, and after said date the allowance payable shall be equal to the retirement allowance said member would have received if retired for service on said date, based on the final compensation he or she would have received prior to said date, had he or she lived and rendered service as assumed, but such allowance shall not be less than 50 percent of such final compensation.  
	If he or she had retired prior to death, the allowance payable shall be equal to one-half of his or her retirement allowance of the member as it was prior to optional modification and prior to reduction as provided in Subsection (a) of Section A8.514 of this Charter, but exclusive of the part of such allowance which was provided by additional contributions, except that if he or she was a member under Section A8.610 and if death occurred prior to qualification for the service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date at which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died. If such retired person leaves no such surviving spouse, or if such surviving spouse should die or remarry before every child of such deceased retired person attains the age of 18 years, the allowance which such surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to retired person's child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. Upon the death of a member after retirement and regardless of the cause of death, a death benefit shall be paid to his or her estate or designated beneficiary in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed by the Board of Supervisors for the payment of a similar death benefit upon the death of other retired members. 
	No allowance, however, shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse following the death of a member unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of injury or onset of the illness which results in death, or unless such surviving spouse was married to said member at least one year prior to his or her retirement. If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.  Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under the age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.

	(b)	if his or her death occurred after the completion of at least 25 years of service in the aggregate but prior to the attainment of the age of 50 years, one-half of the retirement allowance to which he or she would have been entitled under Section A8.610-2 if he or she had attained the age of 50 years on the date of his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, or 
	(c)	if his or her death occurred after retirement for disability by reason of injury received in or illness caused by performance of duty, one-half of his or her retirement allowance as it was at his or her death shall be continued throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse, except that, if death occurred prior to qualification for service retirement allowance, the allowance continued shall be adjusted upon the date on which said member would have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service in the aggregate and attained the age of fifty (50) years, in the same manner as it would have been adjusted had the member not died, or 
	(d)	if his or her death occurred after completion of at least 10 years of service in the aggregate, computed as provided in Section A8.610-10, an allowance in an amount equal to the retirement allowance to which the member would have been entitled pursuant to Section A8.610-3 if he or she had retired on the date of death because of incapacity for performance of duty shall be paid throughout life or until remarriage to his or her surviving spouse.  If there is no surviving spouse entitled to an allowance hereunder, or if he or she dies or remarries before every child of such deceased member attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which the surviving spouse would have received had he or she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his or her child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years.  Should said member leave no surviving spouse and no children under age of 18 years, but leave a child or children, regardless of age, dependent upon him or her for support because partially or totally disabled and unable to earn a livelihood or a parent or parents dependent upon him or her for support, the child or children and the parents so dependent shall collectively receive a monthly allowance equal to that which a surviving spouse otherwise would have received, during such dependency.  No allowance, however shall be paid under this Section to a surviving spouse unless he or she was married to the member prior to the date of the injury or onset of the illness which results in death if he or she had not retired, or unless he or she was married to the member at least one year prior to his or her retirement if he or she had retired. The surviving spouse, in the event of death of the member after qualification for, but before service retirement, may elect before the first payment of the allowance, to receive the benefit provided in Section A8.610-8, in lieu of the allowance which otherwise would be continued to him or her under this Section.  If there is no surviving spouse, the guardian of the eligible child or children may make such election, and if there are no such children, the dependent parent or parents may make such election.

Such portion which is paid because of death or retirement which resulted from injury received in, or illness caused by performance of duty, shall be considered as in lieu of all benefits, other than medical benefits, payable to or on account of such person under such law and shall be in satisfaction and discharge of the obligation of the City and County to pay such benefits.

The provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section shall not prevent such person from receiving the compensation for such position or office.

[A8.900 - A8.910  POLICE DEPARTMENT DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PROGRAM ("DROP")]*
A8.900  PREAMBLE.
	(a)	It is critical to the health, the safety, and economic vitality of the City and County of San Francisco, that the City be able to recruit new Police Officers, and retain veteran Police Officers. Recent experience has demonstrated that the City's Police Department has had difficulty recruiting qualified Police Officers, and, more significantly, has had difficulty retaining the services of veteran Police Officers. 
	(b)	There is a highly competitive labor market for the services of Police Officers. Additionally, due to the historical hiring patterns in this Department, hundreds of Police Officers will become eligible for normal service retirement in the next three to five years. The City Police Department is already three hundred officers below the Charter mandated staffing level. 
	(c)	In order to address this recruitment and this retention problem, through this measure the voters establish a voluntary Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) which would be offered to members of the Police Department in order to create an incentive for the retention of experienced Police Officers, and as well, to attract new Officers. 
	(d)	Specifically, as well, the voters intend that this Charter provision, if adopted, shall be "cost neutral" to the City; that is, it shall not impose new costs upon the City as a consequence of the participation by Police Officers in the DROP. 
	(e)	Finally, in order that the cost impact of the DROP may be assessed, this measure additionally provides that at the end of the third year after the implementation of the Program, the Board of Supervisors, pursuant to data provided by the Police Department along with an analysis by the Controller of the City and County and the consulting actuary of the Retirement Board, shall determine whether the Program has been cost-neutral, and whether in light of its achievement of the goals of the measure, it should be continued for an additional three year term, and thereafter, subject to similar evaluations. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.901  ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PROGRAM.
	(a)	Sworn members of the Police Department occupying the rank of Police Officer (currently Q2—Q4) at their date of entry into the Program, shall be eligible to participate in the DROP for up to a maximum of 36 months from their date of entry into the Program, provided they otherwise meet the eligibility standards set forth in Section A8.901(c). Sworn members of the Police Department occupying the ranks of Sergeant (currently Q50—Q52) and Inspector (currently 0380-0382) at their date of entry into the Program, shall be eligible to participate in the DROP of up to a maximum of 24 months from their date of entry into the Program, provided they otherwise meet the eligibility standards set forth in Section A8.901(c).
	(b)	Sworn members of the Police Department occupying the ranks of Lieutenant (currently Q60—Q62) and Captain (currently Q80—Q82) at their date of entry into the Program shall be eligible to participate in the Program for a maximum of 12 months from their date of entry into the Program, provided that they otherwise meet the eligibility standards set forth in Section A8.901(c). No sworn member of the Police Department occupying a rank above that of Captain shall be eligible to participate in the Program.
	(c)	To be eligible to participate in the DROP, a sworn member occupying one of the eligible ranks must additionally be an active employee of the San Francisco Police Department, have at least 25 years of service as a sworn member of the Department, including any service as a member of the San Francisco Airport Police, and be at least 50 years of age at the time of entry into the Program. Additionally, a member must be a "full duty sworn officer" as that term is used in Charter Section 4.127. As a condition of participation the sworn member must agree that they shall terminate their employment through retirement at the conclusion of their participation in the Program. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.902  EFFECT OF DISABILITY ON CONTINUED PARTICIPATION.
	(a)	If, after a member becomes a participant in the DROP, the member shall become incapacitated for the performance of duty by reason of any bodily injury received in or illness caused by the performance of duty, said member will be eligible to apply for a retirement for incapacity and be subject to the same eligibility requirements provided elsewhere in this Charter as though the participant was not enrolled in the DROP. If a member receives a retirement for this duty related incapacity, said retirement shall be in lieu of the benefits provided in accordance with these DROP provisions, and the participant shall be paid an industrial disability retirement benefit as if the participant had never entered the DROP. 
	(b)	If, after a member becomes a participant in the DROP, the member shall become incapacitated for the performance of duty by reason of any bodily injury received or illness not related to the performance of duty, said member will be eligible to apply to terminate participation in DROP in accordance with Section A8.906. The participant will be paid the balance credited in their DROP Account, and will begin to receive a monthly payment as determined under Section A8.903, including any cost of living adjustments to which the member would otherwise be entitled. 
	(c)	In the event a member shall become temporarily incapacitated for the performance of duty while participating in the DROP, the member is entitled to disability benefits only as provided for in this Charter. The member is thus no longer a "full duty sworn officer," as defined in Section A8.901(c), and therefore the member's service retirement payments will be suspended for the period during which disability benefits are received. The member's DROP enrollment shall be extended for the period during which disability benefits were received, provided that this extension may not exceed one-half of the permitted maximum participation period for the rank occupied by the member at the time of enrollment in the DROP. 
	(d)	In the event a member who is participating in the DROP applies for a retirement for incapacity, and the application remains unresolved at the conclusion of their DROP participation period, that member must leave the DROP when their participation period concludes, but they shall be permitted to continue on disability status with the Department until such time as their application is finally determined. In no event, however, shall any such member receive the distribution of their DROP Account until their disability retirement status is finally determined. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.903  THE EFFECT OF PARTICIPATION IN THE DROP UPON PENSION BENEFIT CALCULATIONS.
	Upon the voluntary entry of a qualified member into the DROP, that member's Retirement System benefits, including survivor benefits, shall be frozen, and shall not be increased as a result of any additional service time, increase in age or compensation earned by the member while they are participating in the DROP. During the period of a member's participation in the DROP, the monthly service pension payment described herein shall be increased by any cost of living adjustment to which the member would otherwise be entitled, if retired, during the period of their participation in the DROP, pursuant to the terms of the retirement plan which applies to the member. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.904  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DROP ACCOUNT.
	(a)	The DROP Account is an account established for book-keeping purposes within the Retirement System for each member who elects to enter DROP. 
	(b)	Commencing with the first pay period after the entry of a member into the DROP, and for each pay period thereafter so long as the member participates in the DROP, the service pension (including any Cost of Living Adjustments) to which the member would otherwise be entitled based on their compensation, age, and length of service as of their date of their entry into the Program, shall be credited monthly into a DROP Account established within the Retirement System for each individual participant. 
	(c)	A participating member, to the extent permitted by law and regulations established by the Retirement Board and the Board of Supervisors, may direct the crediting into that member's DROP Account the dollar value of any compensatory time off, accrued unused vacation, or accrued Sick Pay, if any, to which the member may be entitled, in lieu of receiving a payout of those amounts upon the date of entry into the DROP. 
	(d)	The DROP Account into which the member's monthly service pension is credited shall also be credited on a monthly basis with interest at an annual effective rate of four percent throughout the period of the member's participation in the DROP. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.905  RIGHTS OF SURVIVING SPOUSE, DOMESTIC PARTNER, OR DEPENDENTS.
	(a)	If a member shall die by reason of an injury received in, or illness caused by the performance of duty during the period of their participation in the DROP, the member's qualified surviving spouse, qualified registered/certified domestic partner or other qualified dependents provided for in this Charter shall receive a death allowance pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Charter as if the member had never elected to enter DROP. Whichever of the member's qualified surviving spouse, qualified registered/certified domestic partner or other qualified dependents provided for in this Charter is entitled to receive this allowance may, instead of receiving the benefit under this paragraph, elect to receive a non-work related death benefit as specified in paragraph (b) below. 
	(b)	If a member shall die during the period of their participation in the DROP for non-work related causes, the surviving qualified spouse, qualified registered/certified domestic partner, or other qualified dependents provided for in this Charter, shall be entitled to a post-retirement continuation allowance, along with any amounts credited to the deceased member's DROP Account, determined as if the participant had elected to voluntarily withdraw from DROP under Section A8.906 on the participant's date of death. Such payments shall be made on the basis of beneficiary elections made by the member at the time of his or her entry into DROP, and updated from time to time, as set forth in Section A8.905(d). 
	(c)	In order for a surviving spouse or registered/certified domestic partner to be qualified for the monthly allowance described in this section, the member must have been married, or have established a domestic partnership within the time limits specified by this Charter. In order for surviving dependents to be qualified for the monthly allowance described in this section, such dependents must satisfy the requirements of the retirement provisions of this Charter. In any circumstance where the eligibility requirements specify the member's date of retirement, those requirements must be met at the date of entry into DROP. 
	(d)	A member who elects to participate in the DROP may designate a beneficiary for the proceeds of the member's DROP Account in writing, not later than the time of entry into the DROP. The member may change the designation at any time prior to the distribution of the DROP Account. If the designated beneficiary predeceases the participating member, and the member becomes deceased before designating a new beneficiary, any distribution of the proceeds of the DROP Account shall be made to the estate of the member, pursuant to law. 
	(e)	Notwithstanding the above provisions, a member's designation of a DROP Account beneficiary shall be subject to community property obligations, if any, under applicable California law. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.906  TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION IN THE DROP.
	(a)	A member's participation in the DROP shall be terminated, other than by death or disability, by the first occurrence of any of the following: (1) the member's completion of the applicable DROP participation period set forth in Section A8.901(a) or (b); (2) the member's voluntary termination of employment while a DROP participant; (3) involuntary termination of the member's employment; provided, however, that distribution of the member's DROP Account shall be deferred during the pendency of any hearing or appeal of the member's termination of employment. Should the member be reinstated to employment, the member may continue to participate in the DROP for the full duration of the member's original participation period. Any time during which the member was excluded from DROP participation shall not be deducted from the member's maximum participation period set forth in Section A8.901(a) or (b). 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.907  EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF THE MEMBER DURING PARTICIPATION IN THE DROP.
	(a)	During the period of a member's participation in the DROP, the member shall continue to receive the regular compensation attached to the rank occupied by the member at the time of enrollment in the Program, and the member shall have all of the rights, privileges, benefits and obligations of employment, including health benefits, attached to said rank, and shall be subject to all of the other terms and conditions of active employment in their respective rank and assignment. No member shall be eligible for a promotion during the time of their participation in the DROP. 
	(b)	Notwithstanding the continued receipt by a participating member of the regular compensation and benefits attached to the rank and assignment which they occupy during their time in the DROP, no participating member shall receive service credit or compensation credit for retirement purposes pursuant to this Charter on account of their participation in the DROP. The member shall be subject to the employee contribution, as required by this Charter for all other active members of the Police Department, into the Retirement System. The City and County need not continue to make its required contributions for any DROP participant. Member contributions made during a participation in the DROP shall be deemed a contribution to the general assets of the Retirement System, and shall not be a part of the member's DROP Account. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.908  COMPLIANCE WITH TAX LAWS.
	(a)	It is the intent of the voters that the DROP shall not jeopardize in any way the tax qualified status of the Retirement System under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, including, but not limited to, Section 415 of the Code, as amended. 
	(b)	The Board of Supervisors shall adopt ordinances and the Retirement Board shall adopt such rules as may be necessary to implement the DROP, regulate investment and distribution of the DROP contributions, establish forms and procedures for designating beneficiaries of the DROP Account, and all such other matters as may be necessary, in its discretion, to implement the Program no later than July 1, 2008 and to assure its tax-qualified character. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.909  DETERMINATION OF COST NEUTRALITY.
	(a)	The implementation of the DROP shall not result in any net increase in cost to the City. This determination shall take into account the costs associated with payroll, the expenditures associated with the recruitment and training of Police Officers, the costs of conducting academies for such recruits and trainees, the Field Training Officer costs, the retirement contributions made by members participating in the DROP, and the City, and the City's share of the return on the investment of the DROP funds, along with any other cost or savings elements related to the implementation of the Program. Notwithstanding this objective, the DROP shall be given a sufficient trial period to determine whether, as implemented, it is cost-neutral to the City as so defined. 
	(b)	Not later than April 15, in the third year after the effective date of the DROP, a joint report prepared by the Controller of the City and the consulting actuary of the Retirement System documenting the net cost effect of the Program shall be submitted to the Board of Supervisors, and the Board shall determine by majority vote whether, on the basis of said report, the Program shall be renewed for an additional period of time as specified by the Board, but in no event beyond an additional three years. 
	(c)	The net cost effect of the Program shall be similarly evaluated periodically thereafter, pursuant to a schedule established by ordinance adopted by the Board of Supervisors by majority vote; provided, however, that in no event may such an evaluation be conducted less often than every three years after the initial evaluation. 
	(d)	If the Board of Supervisors determines not to renew the Program, those members then enrolled shall be permitted to complete their Program participation pursuant to the terms in effect when they entered into the Program. 
(Added by Proposition B, Approved 2/5/2008)
A8.910  WITHDRAWAL OR ROLLOVER OF DROP ACCOUNTS.
	(a)	Upon the termination or conclusion of a member's participation in the DROP, the member shall be paid a lump sum equal to the balance in the member's DROP Account, or, pursuant to the member's instructions, that balance shall be paid as a direct rollover into a qualified retirement plan. The Retirement Board shall establish rules, and may develop such forms as may be appropriate, regarding distribution of the DROP Account proceeds, the rollover of such proceeds into a qualified retirement plan, and the time periods within such which distributions may be made. 
	(b)	Upon the voluntary withdrawal of a member from the DROP, or the expiration of their participation period, the member shall be deemed to be retired on a service pension and shall then commence receiving directly the monthly service pension amount calculated pursuant to Section A8.903, including any cost of living adjustments to which the member would have been otherwise entitled during the time of their participation in the DROP, and shall, for all other purposes under this Charter and state law be deemed to be a retired member of the Police Department.

SEC. B7.310.  PIER 70 WATERFRONT DISTRICT.
	(a)	The Port of San Francisco's southern waterfront includes a site known as Pier 70. For over 150 years, some portion of this site has been in use for ship building and repair, or steel production, as well as for other heavy industrial uses. In 2001, the California State Office of Historic Preservation determined that Pier 70's approximately 40 historic buildings, structures, and features are eligible for the National Register collectively as contributors to a Pier 70 historic district. This Section B7.310 is intended to enable the City and County, through its Port Commission, to rehabilitate the Pier 70 area by establishing planning, financing and project approval mechanisms appropriate to the area. These mechanisms will serve a significant public purpose by preserving and restoring historic waterfront properties in need of repair, restoring waterfront land, and building new waterfront parks and maritime facilities. 
	(b)	The Port Commission may submit to the Board of Supervisors for approval a financial and land use plan or plans for all or a portion of Pier 70 (each a "Pier 70 Plan") that includes a description of the boundaries of a Pier 70 planning area ("Pier 70 Waterfront District") and projections of the Port's need for financing, in addition to authorized property tax increment financing, to preserve and restore deteriorated Pier 70 historic waterfront properties, seismically strengthen Pier 70 piers and structures, remediate and restore contaminated waterfront land and structures, build new waterfront parks, and build maritime facilities ("Waterfront Improvements"). The financing plan may include, without limitation, issuance of debt to finance Waterfront Improvements or direct payments to a tenant for the Waterfront Improvements. As used in this Section B7.310, Waterfront Improvements include rehabilitation of an existing historic resource consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, seismic strengthening of existing structures, environmental remediation and/or mitigation consistent with applicable regulations and/or a plan approved by a regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the contaminated area, construction and landscaping of waterfront open space, including natural shoreline habitat, construction of utility infrastructure necessary to achieve compliance with environmental performance standards that exceed applicable building code requirements, and the construction or rehabilitation of maritime facilities. 
	(c)	Before proposing to issue indebtedness to finance Waterfront Improvements or to assume the responsibility to pay for the improvements pursuant to this Section B7.310, the Port Commission, by resolution, must approve a capital budget for the proposed Waterfront Improvements and find that the new lease revenues from private investment in and development of the proposed Pier 70 Waterfront District for a period of 20 years, commencing with the Port's projected date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a lease identified by the Port for all or a portion of the Pier 70 Waterfront District, and property tax increment available under the Pier 70 Plan, are insufficient to finance the Waterfront Improvements. 
	(d)	The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall refer the Pier 70 Plan to the Controller within 30 days after the Port Commission's submission to the Board of Supervisors. Within 90 days of the Clerk's referred, the Controller and the Tax Collector, in consultation with the Department of Real Estate and the Port Commission, shall report to the Board of Supervisors the following: 
		1.	The total amount of taxes received by the City and County from (A) the City Payroll Expense Tax under Article 12-A of the Business and Tax Regulations Code, as amended from time to time (the "Payroll Tax"), from businesses located in the Pier 70 Waterfront District, and (B) Tax on Transient Occupancy of Hotel Rooms under Article 7 of the Business and Tax Regulations Code, as amended from time to time (the "Hotel Tax"), from any hotel rooms located in the Pier 70 Waterfront District (the "Base Year Tax Revenues") in the full fiscal year immediately preceding the submission of the proposed Pier 70 Plan to the Board of Supervisors; and 
		2.	The projected annual increases in Payroll Tax and the Hotel Tax above the Base Year Tax Revenue that will accrue to the General Fund for each year ("Pier 70 Annual Payroll and Hotel Tax Increment") for a twenty year period following the issuance of a certificate of occupancy related to a Port lease identified by the Port for all or a portion of the Pier 70 Waterfront District, using assumptions about new lease and tax revenues from development of allowed uses in the Pier 70 Waterfront District. 
		The publication of the Controller's and Tax Collector's report will not be a violation of Business & Tax Regulations Code Section 6.22-1. The Controller and the Tax Collector shall be entitled to reimbursement of their costs to perform their responsibilities under this Section B7.310. 
	(e)	The Board of Supervisors may approve the Pier 70 Plan, with or without the financing for Waterfront Improvements described by the plan. The Board of Supervisors may approve the financing for Waterfront Improvements described in the plan, if it finds that new lease revenues from private investment in and development of the proposed Pier 70 Waterfront District for a period of twenty years, commencing with the Port's projected date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a lease identified by the Port for all or a portion of the Pier 70 Waterfront District, and property tax increment available under the Pier 70 Plan, are insufficient to finance the Waterfront Improvements. 
	(f)	If the Board of Supervisors approves the Pier 70 Plan and associated financing for Waterfront Improvements, then, for the purposes of this Section B7.310, the Base Year Tax Revenues for the Pier 70 Plan will be the total Payroll Tax from businesses located in the Pier 70 Waterfront District and any Hotel Tax from any hotel rooms in the Pier 70 Waterfront District in the fiscal year preceding Port Commission issuance of debt to finance Waterfront Improvements or obligation to first pay for Waterfront Improvements pursuant to this Section B7.310, and the Controller and the Tax Collector, in consultation with the Department of Real Estate and the Port Commission, shall revise their projections of Pier 70 Annual Payroll and Hotel Tax Increment for a 20-year period, commencing on the Port's projected date of its issuance of debt for, or obligation to pay for the construction of Waterfront Improvements pursuant to this Section B7.310, based on updated assumptions about new lease and tax revenues from development of allowed uses in the Pier 70 Waterfront District. These updated assumptions shall serve as the basis for appropriations pursuant to this Section B7.310 for the remainder of the term of the Pier 70 Plan. 
	(g)	If the Board of Supervisors approves financing for Waterfront Improvements described in the Pier 70 Plan, then the City and County shall appropriate from discretionary General Fund revenues to the harbor trust fund the amount necessary to pay debt service on indebtedness issued by the Port Commission to finance Waterfront Improvements or to fund the Port's obligation to pay for Waterfront Improvements pursuant to this Section B7.310 in an amount up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Pier 70 Annual Payroll and Hotel Tax Increment beginning in the fiscal year in which the Port Commission is obligated to A) begin paying for the Waterfront Improvements, or B) pay debt service on indebtedness that it has issued to finance Waterfront Improvements and for each subsequent fiscal year until the earlier of (i) the date the Controller certifies that the Port Commission has retired all indebtedness issued or to finance the Waterfront Improvements or fully satisfied its obligation to pay for the Waterfront Improvements or (ii) 20 fiscal years commencing with the first fiscal year that the Port Commission is obligated to pay such debt service or payment on the Waterfront Improvements. The City and County shall appropriate the funds to the harbor trust fund notwithstanding the actual amount of the annual increase in Payroll Taxes and Hotel Taxes during any fiscal year, without any adjustment based on the actual amounts of such taxes paid or accruing to the City and County. In no event may the amount appropriated to the harbor trust fund in the aggregate be greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the amount of Pier 70 Annual Payroll and Hotel Tax Increment estimated by the Controller for a 20-year period pursuant to subsection (f). The Port may use the funds appropriated solely to finance the construction of Waterfront Improvements described in its Pier 70 Plan and any amendments to the plan by the Port Commission and the Board of Supervisors. 
	(h)	The Board of Supervisors' approval of the Pier 70 Plan, with or without approval of the financing for Waterfront Improvements, shall constitute approval by the Board of Supervisors of any lease for a project developed under the Pier 70 Plan under Article IX, Section 9.118 of this Charter upon approval by the Port Commission if all of the following conditions are met: 
		1.	The Controller, in consultation with the Department of Real Estate, finds the lease consistent with the Pier 70 Plan;
		2.	If required for purposes of the receipt of federal historic tax credits, the lease binds the lessee to obtain from the National Park Service and/or State Historic Preservation Office a finding of consistency of the federally-subsidized historic rehabilitation project(s) contemplated by the lease with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties; 
		3.	If required, the lease binds the lessee to obtain a permit from the Bay Conservation and Development Commission for the improvement and maintenance of the 100 foot shoreline bond along Pier 70 in the premises of the lease; 
		4.	If required, the State of California has approved the consistency of the Pier 70 Plan, or portions thereof, with the Burton Act trust and the public trust for navigation, commerce and fisheries; and 
		5.	If required, any applicable environmental regulatory agency has approved a site remediation or site management plan, or the equivalent, for the relevant portion of Pier 70, where the Port or a former owner, occupant, or operator is the primarily responsible party. 
(Added by Proposition D, 11/4/2008)
SEC. B7.320.  AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS.
	(a)	The Mayor may submit to the Board of Supervisors for approval a memorandum of understanding or other form of interagency agreement between the Port Commission and another department or departments of the City and County, approved by the Port Commission by resolution, that requires the department(s) to expend funds or to transfer funds to the Port Commission, or requires the Port Commission to transfer funds to the department(s). 
	(b)	If the Board of Supervisors approves the interagency agreement by resolution, the City and County shall appropriate funds sufficient to fund the expenditure or transfer until such time as the agreement expires, or is terminated by the Port Commission and other departmental parties, subject to the approval of the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors by resolution.

Recognizing the difficult economic times the City faces, preservation and enhancement of such services can be achieved only by ensuring that City services are delivered in an efficient, cost- effective manner, and that government waste and unnecessary bureaucracy are curtailed to the greatest extent possible. 
	(b)	It is often difficult for individual San Franciscans to judge the effectiveness and efficiency of local government in providing direct services to residents because of the size and complexity of City government. Consistent with the goals of open government, City government should establish tools to enable residents to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of City services; to compare the City's progress in delivering such services to that of other cities, counties and government agencies; and, where appropriate, to adopt "best practices" used in other jurisdictions when consistent with the goals of San Francisco residents. 
	(c)	The San Francisco Controller is uniquely situated to provide objective, rigorous measurement of City service levels and effectiveness because the Controller is already charged with assessment of departmental performance and fiscal soundness. In addition, the Controller is appointed to a ten-year term, and therefore is sufficiently independent to render impartial assessments of the City's provision of public services. 
	(d)	Therefore, this Charter Amendment:
		(1)	Establishes the Controller as the City Services Auditor, with the authority to conduct independent management and performance audits of departments providing services to San Francisco residents; 
		(2)	Instructs the Controller/City Services Auditor to publish comparisons of the performance of San Francisco departments, the services they deliver, and the outcomes they achieve with other public agencies; 
		(3)	Requires that the Controller/City Services Auditor perform comprehensive financial and performance audits of selected City departments each year; 
		(4)	Mandates that the Controller/City Services Auditor review standards for street and park maintenance in consultation with responsible City departments and perform an annual Clean Streets/Clean Parks audit to track whether these standards are met; 
		(5)	Provides the Controller/City Services Auditor the authority to review Citywide standards for government contracting processes and the development of "Requests For Proposals" to ensure that the selection process is fair and unbiased; 
		(6)	Prohibits conflicts of interest in the auditing process by preventing companies that have participated in departmental operations from acting as outside auditors, requiring that all employees participating in audits be designated confidential employees for labor-relations purposes, and permitting the Controller to obtain outside independent assistance when in-house employees are subject to potential conflicts of interest; 
		(7)	Requires the Controller/City Services Auditor to administer and publicize a whistleblower hotline and website for citizens and employees to report wrongdoing, waste, inefficient practices and poor performance in City government and service delivery; 
		(8)	Authorizes the Citizens' General Obligation Bond Oversight Committee to also function as an independent Citizens Audit Review Board to advise the Controller/City Services Auditor, to recommend departments in need of comprehensive audit, and to review citizen complaints received through the whistleblower program; and 
		(9)	Provides a dedicated source of revenue equivalent to two-tenths of one percent of the budget of the City and County of San Francisco.

F1.101.  CITY SERVICES AUDITOR; SERVICES AUDIT UNIT.
	(a)	In addition to the other duties prescribed by this Charter, the Controller shall perform the duties of a City Services Auditor, responsible for monitoring the level and effectiveness of services provided by the government of the City and County of San Francisco to the people of San Francisco. The City Services Auditor shall establish and maintain a Services Audit Unit in the Controller's Office to ensure the financial integrity and improve the overall performance and efficiency of City government. The Services Audit Unit shall review performance and cost benchmarks developed by City departments in consultation with the Controller and based on their departmental efficiency plans under Chapter 88 of the Administrative Code, and conduct comparisons of the cost and performance of San Francisco City government with other cities, counties and public agencies performing similar functions. In particular, the Services Audit Unit shall assess: 
		(1)	Measures of workload addressing the level of service being provided or providing an assessment of need for a service;
		(2)	Measures of efficiency including cost per unit of service provided, cost per unit of output, or the units of service provided per full time equivalent position; and 
		(3)	Measures of effectiveness including the quality of service provided, citizen perceptions of quality, and the extent a service meets the needs for which it was created. 
	(b)	The service areas for which data is collected and comparisons conducted shall include, but not be limited to:
		(1)	The cleanliness and condition of streets, sidewalks, and the urban environment and landscape;
		(2)	The performance of other public works and government-controlled public utilities, including water and clean water programs;
		(3)	Parks, cultural and recreational facilities;
		(4)	Transportation, as measured by the standards set out in Charter Section 8A.103, provided, however, that primary responsibility for such assessment shall continue to be exercised by the Municipal Transportation Agency pursuant to Charter Section 8A.100 et seq.; 
		(5)	The criminal justice system, including the Police Department, Juvenile and Adult Probation Departments, Sheriff, District Attorney and Public Defender; 
		(6)	Fire and paramedic services;
		(7)	Public health and human services;
		(8)	City management; and,
		(9)	Human resources functions, including personnel and labor relations.
	(c)	The information obtained using the service measurement standards set forth above shall be compiled on at least an annual basis, and the results of such benchmark studies, as well as comparative data, shall be available on the City's website. 
(Added November 2003)
F1.102.  STREET, SIDEWALK, AND PARK CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE.
	(a)	The Services Audit Unit shall conduct annually a performance audit of the City's street, sidewalk, and public park maintenance and cleaning operations. The annual audit shall: 
		(1)	Include quantifiable, measurable, objective standards for street, sidewalk, and park maintenance, to be developed in cooperation and consultation with the Department of Public Works and the Recreation and Park Department; 
		(2)	Based upon such measures, report on the condition of each geographic portion of the City;
		(3)	To the extent that standards are not met, assess the causes of such failure and make recommendations of actions that will enhance the achievement of those standards in the future; 
		(4)	Ensure that all bond funds related to streets, parks and open space are spent in strict accordance with the stated purposes and permissible uses of such bonds, as approved by the voters. 
		Outside of the audit process, the City departments charged with cleaning and maintaining streets, sidewalks, and parks shall remain responsible for addressing individual complaints regarding specific sites, although the Controller may receive and investigate such complaints under Section F1.107. 
	(b)	In addition, all City agencies engaged in street, sidewalk, or park maintenance shall establish regular maintenance schedules for streets, sidewalks, parks and park facilities, which shall be available to the public and on the department's website. Each such department shall monitor compliance with these schedules, and shall publish regularly data showing the extent to which the department has met its published schedules. The City Services Audit Unit shall audit each department's compliance with these requirements annually, and shall furnish recommendations for meaningful ways in which information regarding the timing, amount and kind of services provided may be gathered and furnished to the public. 
(Added November 2003)
F1.103.  MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
	The City Services Audit Unit shall: 
	(1)	Conduct and publish an annual review of management and employment practices, including City policies and MOU provisions, that either promote or impede the effective and efficient operation of City government; 
	(2)	Identify the top five City departments by workers compensation claims, list the cost of these claims, and recommend ways to reduce both workplace injuries and improper claims; 
	(3)	Identify the top five departments by overtime expenditures and report on the cause and potential mitigations for any excessive overtime spending; and, 
	(4)	Conduct best practices reviews and other studies and assist departments in implementing their findings.

	The City Services Audit Unit shall conduct periodic, comprehensive financial and performance audits of City departments, services, and activities. Except as provided in Section F1.102, the Controller shall have discretion to select, on a rotating basis, departments, services, and activities for audit, giving priority to matters affecting direct services to the residents of the City and County of San Francisco. In selecting audit subjects, the Controller shall give preference to requests for performance audits made by the Audit Review Board, the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors, department heads, and commissions; provided, however, that absent extraordinary circumstances, no department, activity, or service shall be subject to repeated audits in two successive years. 
(Added November 2003)
F1.105.  AUDIT RESULTS.
	(a)	Before making public any portion of any draft, notes, preliminary or final report relating to the operations or activities of a City officer or agency, the Controller shall deliver a copy of the draft report to any such officer, and to the head of any agency discussed in such report and provide the officer and agency, in writing, with a reasonable deadline for their review and response. The Controller shall include in any report, or portion thereof that is made public, a copy or summary of all such officer and agency responses. In addition, the audit shall include an analysis of the anticipated costs and/or savings of any recommendations contained in the report. 
	(b)	The Controller shall publish the results of all final performance audits and a summary of agency responses, shall deliver copies of such audits to relevant department heads, Audit Review Board, Mayor, City Attorney, Board of Supervisors, San Francisco Civil Grand Jury, and San Francisco Public Library, and shall make the audits available on the City's website. Each department subject to recommendations by the Controller shall include with its next two annual budget requests following such audit a report on the status of the Controller's recommendations. In particular, the report shall include: 
		(1)	the Controller's final audit recommendations;
		(2)	a plan to address the Controller's findings and to implement the Controller's recommendations;
		(3)	any costs or savings reflected in the proposed budget attributable to implementation of Controller recommendations; and
		(4)	a statement of the recommendations that the department does not intend to implement and the basis of the department head's determination not to adopt the Controller's recommendation. 
	(c)	To avoid conflicts of interest, all employees engaged in preparation of audits shall be designated as confidential employees. If the Controller determines that any member of the regular audit staff is unable to participate in an audit due to a potential conflict of interest, or as a result of the employee's collective bargaining representation, the Controller shall have the option of assigning other employees regardless of civil service job description, hiring outside experts, or contracting for such services with an outside individual or agency. 
(Added November 2003)
F1.106.  OVERSIGHT OF CONTRACTING PROCEDURES.
	The Controller shall have the duty to perform regular oversight of the City's contracting procedures, including developing model criteria and terms for City Requests for Proposals (RFPs), auditing compliance with City contracting rules and procedures, and, where appropriate, investigating cases of alleged abuse or conflict of interest. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to alter the existing jurisdiction of City departments and agencies with respect to contracting. Should the Controller find that there has been an abuse or conflict of interest, he or she shall refer that finding to the Ethics Commission, the District Attorney, and the City Attorney for possible enforcement action. 
(Added November 2003)

		(1)	another City agency is required by federal, state, or local law to adjudicate,
		(2)	may be resolved through a grievance mechanism established by collective bargaining agreement or contract,
