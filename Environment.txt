PREFACE TO THE ENVIRONMENT CODE 
	On July 3, 2003, the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor adopted this Municipal Environment Code. The Environment Code was developed to consolidate the City's ordinances governing protection of the environment, natural resources and sustainability that were previously scattered throughout the Administrative Code. 
	This electronic version of the City and County of San Francisco Municipal Code is updated as amending legislation is approved. New Ordinance Notices are inserted where applicable to call the user's attention to material that has been affected by legislation that has been passed but is not yet effective. Any references to such legislation are also compiled in a table at the end of this Code. The amendments are then incorporated into the Code when they become effective.
	Beginning with ordinances passed in 2011, all ordinances affecting this Code are summarized in a table that lists the identifying information (ordinance and file numbers), effective date, short title, and sections affected for each such ordinance. Users should note that the operative date of an ordinance may be later than the effective date of the ordinance. A delayed operative date will be noted in the ordinance.
	This Code may contain various Editor's Notes (explaining the disposition of or cross referencing various provisions), and/or Codification Notes (documenting scrivener's errors and the like found in the underlying ordinances). Such notes have been inserted by the publisher for the convenience of the user or as historical references. They have not been approved or adopted by the City and County of San Francisco, and are of no legal force or effect.

CHAPTER 1:
PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE POLICY STATEMENT 
Sec. 100.Findings. Sec. 101.The San Francisco Precautionary Principle. Sec. 102.Three Year Review. Sec. 103.List of All Environmental Ordinances and Resolutions.Sec. 104.City Undertaking Limited to Promotion of General Welfare. 
SEC. 100.  FINDINGS. 
	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares that: 
	A.	Every San Franciscan has an equal right to a healthy and safe environment. This requires that our air, water, land, and food be of a sufficiently high standard that individuals and communities can live healthy, fulfilling, and dignified lives. The duty to enhance, protect and preserve San Francisco's environment rests on the shoulders of government, residents, citizen groups and businesses alike. 
	B.	Historically, environmentally harmful activities have only been stopped after they have manifested extreme environmental degradation or exposed people to harm. In the case of PCBs, DDT, lead, and asbestos, for instance, regulatory action took place only after disaster had struck. The delay between first knowledge of harm and appropriate action to deal with it can be measured in human lives cut short. 
	C.	San Francisco is a leader in making choices based on the least environmentally harmful alternatives, thereby challenging traditional assumptions about risk management. Numerous City ordinances including: the Integrated Pest Management Ordinance, the Resource Efficient Building Ordinance, the Healthy Air Ordinance, the Resource Conservation Ordinance, and the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Ordinance apply a precautionary approach to specific City purchases and activities. Internationally, this model is called the Precautionary Principle. 
	D.	As the City consolidates existing environmental laws into a single Environment Code, and builds a framework for future legislation, the Precautionary Principle approach will serve as a policy framework to develop and implement laws for a healthier and more just San Francisco. In this way, the City will create and maintain a healthy, viable Bay Area environmental for current and future generations, and will become a model of sustainability. 
	E.	Science and technology are creating new solutions to prevent or mitigate environmental problems. However, science is also creating new compounds and chemicals that are already finding their way into mother's milk and causing other new problems. New legislation may be required to address these situations, and the Precautionary Principle is intended as a tool to help promote environmentally healthy alternatives while weeding out the negative and often unintended consequences of new technologies. 
	F.	A central element of the precautionary approach is the careful assessment of available alternatives using the best available science. An alternatives assessment examines a broad range of options in order to present the public with the consequences of each approach. The process takes short-term versus long-term effects or costs into consideration, and evaluates and compares the adverse or potentially adverse effects of each option, giving preference to those options with fewer potential hazards. This process allows fundamental questions to be asked: "Is this potentially hazardous activity necessary?" "What less hazardous options are available?" and "How little damage is possible?" 
	G.	The alternatives assessment is also a public process because, locally or internationally, the public bears the ecological and health consequences of environmental decisions. A government's course of action is necessarily enriched by broadly based public participation when a full range of alternatives is considered based on input from diverse individuals and groups. The public should be able to determine the range of specific alternatives to be examined. For each alternative the public should consider both immediate and long-term consequences, as well as possible impacts to the local economy. 
	H.	This form of open decision-making is in line with San Francisco's historic Sunshine Act, which allows citizens to have full view of the legislative process. One of the goals of the Precautionary Principle is to include citizens as equal partners in decisions affecting their health and environment. 
	I.	San Francisco looks forward to the time when the City's power is generated from renewable sources, when all our waste is recycled, when our vehicles produce only potable water as emissions, when the Bay is free from toxins, and the oceans are free from pollutants. The Precautionary Principle provides a means to help us attain these goals as we evaluate future laws and policies in such areas as transportation, construction, land use, planning, water, energy, health care, recreation, purchasing, and public expenditure. 
	J.	Transforming our society to realize these goals and achieving a society living respectfully with the bounds of nature will take a behavioral as well as technological revolution. The Precautionary approach to decision-making will help San Francisco speed this process of change by moving beyond finding cures for environmental ills to preventing the ills before they can do harm. 
(Added by Ord. 171-03, File No. 030422, App. 7/3/2003) 
SEC. 101.  THE SAN FRANCISCO PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. 
	The following shall constitute the City and County of San Francisco's Precautionary Principle policy. All officers, boards, commission, and departments of the City and County shall implement the Precautionary Principle in conducting the City and County's affairs: The Precautionary Principle requires a thorough exploration and a careful analysis of a wide range of alternatives. Based on the best available science, the Precautionary Principle requires the selection of the alternative that presents the least potential treat to human health and the City's natural systems. Public participation and an open and transparent decision making process are critical to finding and selecting alternatives. Where threats of serious or irreversible damage to people or nature exist, lack of full scientific certainty about cause and effect shall not be viewed as sufficient reason for the City to postpone cost effective measures to prevent the degradation of the environment or protect the health of its citizens. Any gaps in scientific data uncovered by the examination of alternatives will provide a guidepost for future research, but will not prevent the City from taking protective action. As new scientific data become available, the City will review its decisions and make adjustments when warranted. Where there are reasonable grounds for concern, the precautionary approach to decision-making is meant to help reduce harm by triggering a process to select the least potential threat. The key elements of the Precautionary Principle approach to decision-making include: 
	1.	Anticipatory Action: There is a duty to take anticipatory action to prevent harm. Government, business, and community groups, as well as the general public, share this responsibility. 
	2.	Right to Know: The community has a right to know complete and accurate information on potential human health and environmental impacts associated with the selection of products, services, operations or plans. The burden to supply this information lies with the proponent, not with the general public. 
	3.	Alternatives Assessment: An obligation exists to examine a full range of alternatives and select the alternative with the least potential impact on human health and the environment including the alternative of doing nothing. 
	4.	Full Cost Accounting: When evaluating potential alternatives, there is a duty to consider all the reasonably foreseeable costs, including raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, 
	Precautionary Principle Policy Statement use, cleanup, eventual disposal, and health costs even if such costs are not reflected in the initial price. Short-and long-term benefits and time thresholds should be considered when making decisions. 5. Participatory Decision Process: Decisions applying the Precautionary Principle must be transparent, participatory, and informed by the best available science and other relevant information. 
(Added by Ord. 171-03, File No. 030422, App. 7/3/2003) 
SEC. 102.  THREE YEAR REVIEW. 
	No later than three years from the effective date of this ordinance, and after a public hearing, the Commission on the Environment shall submit a report to the Board of Supervisors on the effectiveness of the Precautionary Principle policy. 
(Added by Ord. 171-03, File No. 030422, App. 7/3/2003) 
SEC. 103.  LIST OF ALL ENVIRONMENTAL ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS. 
	The Director of the Department of the Environment shall produce and maintain a list of all City and County of San Francisco ordinances and resolutions which affect or relate to the environment and shall post this list on the Department of the Environment's website. 
(Added by Ord. 171-03, File No. 030422, App. 7/3/2003) 
SEC. 104.  CITY UNDERTAKING LIMITED TO PROMOTION OF GENERAL WELFARE. 
	The Board of Supervisors encourages all City employees and officials to take the precautionary principle into consideration and evaluate alternatives when taking actions that could impact health and the environment, especially where those actions could pose threats of serious harm or irreversible damage. This ordinance does not impose specific duties upon any City employee or official to take specific actions. In adopting and undertaking the enforcement of this ordinance, the City and County of San Francisco is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its officers and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach proximately caused injury nor may this ordinance provide any basis for any other judicial relief including, but not limited to a writ of mandamus or an injunction. In adopting this Chapter, the Board of Supervisors does not intend to authorize or require the disclosure to the public of any proprietary information protected under the laws of the State of California.

CHAPTER 2:
ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PURCHASING ORDINANCE 
Sec. 200.Findings. Sec. 201.Goals. Sec. 202.Definitions. Sec. 203.Commission and Department of the Environment Duties. Sec. 204.Applicability. Sec. 205.Duties of City Departments. Sec. 206.Waivers. Sec. 207.Trade Secrets. Sec. 208.Enforcement. Sec. 209.Preemption. Sec. 210.Severability. 
SEC. 200.  FINDINGS. 
	A.	Under this Chapter, the City and County of San Francisco wishes to exercise its power to make economic decisions involving its own funds as a participant in the marketplace and to conduct its own business as a municipal corporation to ensure that purchases of commodities and expenditures of public money are made in a manner consistent with its human health and environmental policies. 
	B.	The results of a three year pilot study implementing environmentally preferable purchasing for City departments demonstrated the feasibility of developing relevant human health and environmental selection criteria for products used to maintain City buildings and vehicle fleets. The pilot program further demonstrated that products meeting these criteria are available, cost competitive, and effective at meeting the City's performance standards. It is the City's intention that ultimately there will be environmentally preferable alternatives for each commodity regularly purchased by the City. 
	C.	The Precautionary Principle calls for full disclosure by manufacturers and suppliers so the most protective standard can be applied in the comparison of potential alternatives. Only the full disclosure of ingredients and impacts of the products and services will allow the City to make informed and protective decisions. For example, suppliers of pesticides should disclose the "inert" ingredients in products used on City property instead of limiting disclosure to the legal requirement of "active" ingredients which may make up less than 1% of the product. 
	D.	The Precautionary Principle calls for a participatory and transparent process in the evaluation and selection of potential alternatives. Participation in decision-making by impacted communities is a basic tenet of the Precautionary Principle. Citizens of San Francisco enacted the Sunshine Ordinance to ensure transparency in City government; the Commission on the Environment operates under the mandates of the Sunshine Ordinance in addition to the requirements of the Brown Act and Public Records Act. Above and beyond that, deliberations and decisions under this ordinance made in accordance with the Public Participation Guidelines shall be made in concert with affected community members; community involvement is as central to the process as data gathering and expert advice. 
	E.	Purchases of commodities made by the City and County of San Francisco that are consistent with the Precautionary Principle will encourage market development of new, healthy, environmentally preferable technologies and products and will demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to other government agencies, residents and businesses which will help generate regional demand for healthy products, a healthy way of doing business, product innovation, and business development and competition. 
	F.	Implementing the Precautionary Principle is both good science and good economics. Precautionary action benefits workers, stimulates innovation and supports timely action to avoid costs to public health and the environment. Precautionary business practice leads to expanded local production, job creation and the development of technologies that support job creation in the area of environmentally preferable products. To this end, the Department of the Environment, the Small Business Commission, the Office of Contract Administration and the Human Rights Commission will work together to ensure that there is sufficient outreach, education and training provided to disadvantaged businesses in order to create equitable access and competition for city contracts affected by precautionary purchasing. 
	G.	Many of the City's purchasing decisions have impacts across departmental boundaries. Therefore, interdepartmental cooperation is a key element to a successful precautionary purchasing program. City staff must work closely together to create opportunities for the exchange of ideas and the flow of information between departments and the larger community.

SEC. 201.  GOALS. 
	The purpose of this Chapter is to reduce negative impacts to human health and the environment through the development of specifications for City purchases that: 
		1.	Reduce occupational health hazards for City staff as well as reduce exposure of City residents and visitors to potentially toxic chemicals by purchasing products for use in City operations that do not harm human health or the environment; 
		2.	Reduce San Francisco's contribution to global climate change by purchasing products that lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Commodities; 
		3.	Improve the air quality for San Francisco residents and visitors by purchasing vehicles and motorized equipment that minimize emissions of air pollutants; 
		4.	Protect the quality of San Francisco's ground and surface waters by eliminating the use of chemicals known to contaminate local water resources through toxicity, bioaccumulation or persistence; and 
		5.	Preserve resources locally and globally through purchasing practices that include: 
			(i)	Maximizing water and energy efficiency and favoring renewable energy sources; 
			(ii)	Maximizing post consumer recycled content and readily recyclable or compostable materials; 
			(iii)	Favoring long-term use through product durability, repairability, and refuse; and 
			(iv)	Considering life cycle economics of a product that includes manufacture, transportation, use and disposal.

	(a)	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that it shall be the policy of the City and County of San Francisco for City departments and City contractors who apply pesticides to City property to eliminate or reduce pesticide applications on City property to the maximum extent feasible. 
	(b)	Under this Chapter, the City and County of San Francisco wishes to exercise its power to make economic decisions involving its own funds as a participant in the marketplace and to conduct its own business as a municipal corporation to ensure that purchases and expenditures of public monies are made in a manner consistent with integrated pest management policies and practices. 
	(c)	This Chapter 3 concerns the application of pesticides to property owned by the City and County of San Francisco only, and does not concern the application of pesticides to property that is not owned by the City and County of San Francisco. 
	(d)	City departments shall implement the following City Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Policy: 

CITY INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT POLICY 
	The City, in carrying out its operations, shall assume pesticides are potentially hazardous to human and environmental health. City departments shall give preference to reasonably available nonpesticide alternatives when considering the use of pesticides on City property. For all pest problems on City property, City departments shall follow the integrated pest management (IPM) approach outlined below. 
		(1)	Monitor each pest ecosystem to determine pest population, size, occurrence, and natural enemy population, if present. Identify decisions and practices that could affect pest populations. Keep records of such monitoring; 
		(2)	Set for each pest at each site and identify in an IPM implementation plan, an injury level, based on how much biological, aesthetic or economic damage the site can tolerate; 
		(3)	Consider a range of potential treatments for the pest problem. Employ nonpesticide management tactics first. Consider the use of chemicals only as a last resort and select and use chemicals only within an IPM program and in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
			(A)	Determine the most effective treatment time, based on pest biology and other variables, such as weather, seasonal changes in wildlife use and local conditions, 
			(B)	Design and construct indoor and outdoor areas to reduce and eliminate pest habitats, 
			(C)	Modify management practices, including watering, mulching, waste management, and food storage, 
			(D)	Modify pest ecosystems to reduce food and living space, 
			(E)	Use physical controls such as hand-weeding, traps and barriers, 
			(F)	Use biological controls (introducing or enhancing pests' natural enemies); 
		(4)	Conduct ongoing educational programs: 
			(A)	Acquaint staff with pest biologies, the IPM approach, new pest management strategies as they become known, and toxicology of pesticides proposed for use, 
			(B)	Inform the public of the City's attempt to reduce pesticide use and respond to questions from the public about the City's pest management practices; 
		(5)	Monitor treatment to evaluate effectiveness. Keep monitoring records and include them in the IPM implementation plan. 
	(e)	Nothing in this Chapter is intended to apply to pesticide applications that are required to comply with Federal, State or local laws or regulations. 
	(f)	This Chapter applies the Precautionary Principle to the selection of reduced risk pesticides and other pest management techniques on City property with the intent of minimizing negative impacts on human health and the environment.

 SEC. 400.  HEALTHY AIR AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. 
	(a)	Title. Sections 400 through 424 of this Chapter shall be known as the Healthy Air And Clean Transportation Ordinance. 
	(b)	Purpose. The Healthy Air And Clean Transportation Ordinance is intended to assist the City in achieving its air pollution and greenhouse gas reduction goals by: promoting the use of vehicles that have zero or super ultra-low emissions, achieve high energy efficiency and use alternative fuels with a low carbon impact; implementing policies to minimize the use of single occupancy vehicles and reduce the total number of passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks in the municipal fleet; maximizing the use of outside sources to fund such programs; encouraging the creation, expansion, and maintenance of alternative fueling infrastructure in the City and at City facilities; encouraging trip reduction, carpooling, and public transit, and to increase bicycle commuting by providing cyclists with the opportunity to securely park their bicycles in or close to their workplaces.
	(c)	Findings. 
		(1)	Air pollution endangers public health. According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the levels and concentrations of smog forming, lung-clogging pollutants in the Bay Area, such as ozone and particulate matter (soot particles), not only exceed California's existing health-based standards, but also are often times measured at levels that are two to three times the standards. According to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), emissions from motor vehicles are the leading cause of air pollution in the Bay Area. Furthermore, during the summer of 2006, the San Francisco Bay Area endured more days where emissions of ozone-forming pollutants exceeded Federal and State health-based air quality standards than it has experienced in nearly ten years. 
		(2)	According to the American Lung Association of California, high levels of air pollution cause premature death, and aggravate lung illnesses such as acute respiratory infections, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Coughing, wheezing, chest pain, eye irritation, and headaches are common reactions to air pollution. Sensitive groups, like children, the elderly, athletes, and people with compromised immune systems, are even more susceptible to the detrimental health effects caused by air pollution. In these sensitive groups, poor air quality causes more significant health impacts such as breathing difficulties and weakening of the body's ability to resist disease. 
		(3)	According to the California Air Resources Board, the annual health impacts of exceeding state health-based standards for ozone and particulate matter include: 8,800 premature deaths; 8,200 hospital admissions for respiratory disease; 340,000 asthma attacks; 3,000 asthma-related emergency room visits; 3,000 hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease; 4.7 million school absences due to respiratory conditions, including asthma; 2.8 million lost workdays; and, reduced lung function growth rates in children. 
		(4)	Emissions from motor vehicles are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Statewide, the California Air Resources Board has found that 41 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, a major greenhouse gas, stem from the transportation sector. In San Francisco, the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in the City's Climate Action Plan shows that vehicles belonging to San Francisco residents or otherwise traveling in and out of San Francisco contributed 51 percent of all greenhouse gases generated in the City in 1990. In 2002, the Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution 158-02, "Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions," to support efforts to curb global warming and set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals for the City and County of San Francisco. The City's Climate Action Plan establishes the goal of reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and other sources in the City to 20 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2012. 
		(5)	Near-total reliance on petroleum for transportation fuel jeopardizes San Francisco's economic security. The San Francisco region and the State of California rely on petroleum for 96 percent of all transportation fuel. Diversifying the supply of transportation fuels available in the San Francisco region, and particularly increasing supplies of alternative fuels that have low carbon impact and are sustainable, will help provide a more stable and secure base for the region's economy by making it less vulnerable to interruptions in petroleum supplies while also improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
		(6)	Urban Environmental Accords commit San Francisco to take actions to achieve clean transportation. In 2005, San Francisco became a signatory participant in the Urban Environmental Accords, established on the occasion of the United Nations Environmental Program's World Environment Day in San Francisco. The Accords call on participating cities around the world to reduce smog-forming and other polluting emissions from public fleets by 50 percent in seven years, to expand the availability of affordable public transportation, and to reduce single-occupancy commute trips by 10 percent in seven years. 
		(7)	In 1997, the Board of Supervisors approved the Sustainability Plan for the City and County of San Francisco. The Sustainability Plan states, "[a]chieving and maintaining good air quality is crucial to the public health and economic vitality of San Francisco." 
		(8)	The City and County of San Francisco's fleet includes more than eight hundred (800) clean passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. These include compressed natural gas, hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. 
		(9)	Creating a safe, secure place for cyclists to store their bicycles while at work will help to promote alternative modes of transportation and contribute to the City's effort to cut emissions, improve air quality, maximize public transportation and ease congestion, thus reaping tremendous environmental, public health, and quality of life benefits for the City and its residents. Allowing bicycles in office buildings is an effective way to encourage cycling.

SEC. 500.  FINDINGS. 
	The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco hereby finds and declares as follows: 
	(A)	The California Integrated Waste Management Act (Public Resources Code § 40000 et seq.) requires all cities and counties to reduce their waste by 50% by the year 2000 or face potential penalties of up to $10,000 per day. The City must take a leadership role and act quickly and responsibly to implement the necessary measures to achieve this mandate. 
	(B)	City departmental operations and activities have been found to contribute significantly to San Francisco's solid waste stream. The waste management and buy recycled provisions of this ordinance are necessary to help departments reduce their waste. 
	(C)	On September 14, 1998, the President of the United States signed Executive Order 13101 Greening the Government through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition to "strengthen the role of the Federal government as an enlightened, environmentally conscious and concerned consumer." The State and Federal governments have strongly encouraged local governments to procure recycled and environmentally preferable products and services as a way to increase market demand for such products. 
	(D)	Local agencies that use appropriated federal funds to procure $10,000 or more worth of a designated item in a given year are subject to the federal comprehensive procurement guidelines for recycled products. 
	(E)	Pursuant to Board of Supervisors Resolution No. 246-99, Establishing Dioxin as a High Priority for Immediate Action for the City and County of San Francisco in Order to Restore Water Quality and Protect the Public Health and Enabling the San Francisco Commission on the Environment to Create a Task Force and Report Back on Strategies to Ensure that Less Toxic, Non-Chlorinated Sustainable Products and Processes are Actively Supported, each City department must report to the Board of Supervisors on strategies they are using to ensure that less-toxic, non-chlorinated products sustainable alternative products, such as chlorine-free paper and PVC-free plastics, are actively supported and used. 
	(F)	The landfill capacity available to San Francisco at the Altamont Landfill is expected to last only until approximately 2012. 
	(G)	The discard of useable or recyclable materials into the waste stream deprives the City of the economic benefit of the value of these materials while creating unnecessary expenses for collection and disposal. 
	(H)	This Chapter applies the Precautionary Principle to the selection of commodities used in City operations that minimize impacts on natural resources by maximizing recycled content, recycling, and reuse.

SEC. 700.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
	The Board of Supervisors finds that:
	1.	Buildings are one of the distinguishing elements of human civilization. Traditional building design and construction practices have significant negative environmental impacts. In the United States, buildings consume 48 percent of all energy, 76 percent of all electricity, and generate 38 percent of all carbon (CO2) emissions. In San Francisco, buildings consume 54 percent of all energy, 80 percent of all electricity, and generate 56 percent of all carbon emissions. Advanced green buildings can generate their own energy, minimize carbon emissions, produce and process their own water, emphasize reuse of buildings and materials, and provide healthy interior environments.
	2.	The selection of sustainable design features and building materials is consistent with the City's Precautionary Principle Policy. This policy requires that the City consider a full range of alternatives in order to select products and procedures that minimize harm and maximize the protection of public health and natural resources.
	3.	The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) is a non-profit organization committed to a prosperous and sustainable future for our nation through cost-efficient and energy-saving green buildings. LEED® is an internationally-recognized green building certification system, developed by the USGBC.
	4.	Green buildings provide financial benefits while protecting human and environmental health. Total construction costs for buildings seeking LEED certification fall into the existing range of costs for buildings not seeking LEED certification. Green buildings, on average, result in savings of 20 percent of total construction costs over the first 20 years of operation.

CHAPTER 8:
TROPICAL HARDWOOD AND VIRGIN REDWOOD BAN 
Sec. 800.Findings.Sec. 801.Definitions. Sec. 802.Contracts for Services. Sec. 803.Purchase or Other Acquisition of Commodities. Sec. 804.Contract Conditions. Sec. 805.Rules and Regulations. Sec. 806.Public Records. Sec. 807.Penalty.Sec. 808.Implementation Reports. Sec. 809.Severability. 
SEC. 800.  FINDINGS. 
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that: 
		(1)	The world's equatorial tropical rainforests are the Earth's oldest and richest terrestrial ecological systems. The tropical rainforests are home to half of all the Earth's plant and animal species as well as thousands of indigenous tribal peoples. 
		(2)	The tropical rainforests are being destroyed worldwide, through commercial logging, burning and overcutting, at a rate of 50,000 acres per day, and this rate is accelerating. 
		(3)	Over 1/4 of all rainforest destruction results from logging of the rainforests to support the international trade in tropical hardwoods. 
		(4)	The United States is the third largest importer of tropical hardwoods. 
		(5)	Deforestation of the tropical rainforests has been scientifically linked to atmospheric imbalance and global warming, known as the Greenhouse Effect, caused by increased concentrations of CO2 in the global atmosphere. The effects of global warming include drought, floods, melting of the polar ice caps and changes in weather patterns worldwide. 
		(6)	Destruction of the rainforest at the current rate results in the endangerment and extinction of 30 species of plant and animal life each day and a consequent loss of genetic diversity invaluable to the production of medicines and food products. 
		(7)	Tropical rainforest deforestation causes the displacement of indigenous tribal peoples, many of whom have never before been contacted by the modern world. Displacement results in the death of these people and destruction of their culture, and loss of their intimate knowledge of commercial, medicinal and nutritional uses of rainforest species, which is often superior to that of any western-trained scientist. 
		(8)	It is critical to the survival of the planet that the United States and other industrialized nations take immediate measures to curb consumption of tropical hardwoods in order to halt the deforestation of the rainforests and to avert irreversible global environmental destruction. 
		(9)	Virgin redwood forests are an ancient and irreplaceable part of our State and national heritage that should be preserved for future generations. 
		(10)	Virgin redwood forests provide the only surviving habitat for rare species such as the marbled murrelet and the northern spotted owl. In addition, these forests protect the streams that provide the increasingly rare habitat of dwindling numbers of salmon and steelhead. 
		(11)	Only four percent of the virgin redwood forests originally found in the United States remain in existence, and these forests are under threat of destruction through commercial logging. 
		(12)	Prohibiting the City and County's use of tropical hardwoods, tropical hardwood wood products, virgin redwood and virgin redwood wood products will contribute to a necessary reduction in the demand for these products. Such a prohibition would not create shortages of building supplies for the City, inasmuch as many acceptable non-tropical hardwood equivalents and non-virgin redwood equivalents are available. 
		(13)	Many non-tropical hardwood equivalents are grown domestically in the United States. A prohibition on the City's use of tropical woods would therefore stimulate domestic business and create jobs for American timber workers. 
		(14)	Under this Article the City and County of San Francisco wishes to exercise its power to make economic decisions involving its own funds as a participant in the marketplace and to conduct its own business as a municipal corporation to ensure that purchases and expenditures of public monies are made in a manner consistent with sound environmental policies and practices. The City enacts this Article to prohibit the use, requisition or purchase, directly or indirectly, by any City or County department or agency, of any tropical hardwoods or tropical hardwood wood products as well as virgin redwood or virgin redwood wood products. 
		(15)	This Chapter applies the Precautionary Principle to the selection of lumber and wood products used in City operations in order to protect tropical and old-growth forest ecosystems.

Sec. 1310.Guidelines. 
SEC. 1300.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares that: 
	(a)	Preservative-treated wood containing arsenic poses potential health risks to children in San Francisco who are potentially exposed to arsenic, a known human carcinogen, by playing on City wooden playground and park equipment. Studies conducted in California, Connecticut and Florida suggest that arsenic leaches from preservative-treated wood containing arsenic and can end up on children's hands and in their mouths. 
	(b)	California Health and Safety Code Section 115775 requires that play structures constructed with preservative-treated wood containing arsenic be adequately sealed every two years. 
	(c)	Preservative-treated wood containing arsenic poses potential human health and environmental risks through the release of arsenic during manufacture, installation, and disposal of wood. 
	(d)	There are a variety of alternatives to preservative-treated wood containing arsenic compounds readily available throughout California. 
	(e)	Preservative-treated wood is also used for saltwater immersion environments for structures such as pilings and piers, but until such time as a viable alternative is available, best management practices should be followed for these uses. 
	(f)	Under this Chapter, the City and County of San Francisco wishes to exercise its power to make economic decisions involving its own funds as a participant in the marketplace and to conduct its own business as a municipal corporation to ensure that purchases and expenditures of public monies are made in a manner consistent with its policies. 
	(g)	This Chapter applies the Precautionary Principle to the selection and maintenance of pressure treated wood used to build City structures such as buildings, decks, fences, and play equipment by banning the use of arsenic-containing wood preservatives and requiring protective sealing of existing structures.

	Ordinance 27-06, File No. 051142, Approved February 16, 2006, from which Chapter 14 of this Code derives, shall take effect on July 1, 2006. 
SEC. 1400.  FINDINGS. 
	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares the following: 
	A.	People who live in, work in or visit San Francisco generate 1.8 million tons of solid waste annually with more than half of these materials recovered through waste prevention, recycling and composting. 
	B.	The State of California through its California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939), requires that each local jurisdiction in the state divert 50% of discarded materials (base year 1990) from landfill. Every city and county in California, including the City, could face fines up to $10,000 a day for not meeting the above mandated goal. 
	C.	The Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) for San Francisco adopted by the Board of Supervisors in 1992, recognized the importance of recovering wood, metals, and inerts from construction and demolition activities in order to meet the state mandated waste reduction goal. 
	D.	The Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 679-02 setting a goal of 75% diversion from landfill by 2010 and promoting the highest and best use of recovered materials and authorizing the Commission on the Environment to adopt a zero waste goal, which it set as 2020. 
	E.	The Green Building Ordinance, Chapter 7 of the Environment Code, establishes LEEDTM Silver level as the standard for all City building projects, which can include the goal of diverting 75% of construction and demolition debris from landfill for each project. 
	F.	There are facilities both within the City and in nearby surrounding areas that can effectively reuse, recycle or otherwise recover the constituent elements of the materials generated by construction and demolition activity and thereby divert such materials from landfill. 
	G.	Construction and demolition waste recovery programs reduce the amount of materials generated and hauled to landfill, decrease worker exposure to hazards, improve worker safety, reduce truck trips and traffic and improve air quality, thereby enhancing the health, safety and welfare of San Franciscans. 
	H.	This Chapter requires construction and demolition debris to be transported by a registered vehicle and processed by a registered facility in order to ensure proper handling and to recover an additional estimated 100,000 tons from landfill disposal annually.
	I.	State law requires the California Integrated Waste Management Board to adopt a model construction and demolition debris ordinance and requires that Board to take into account a city's efforts to encourage or require recovery of construction and demolition debris in determining whether a city has met the mandated 50% recovery rate and other solid waste reduction and recycling requirements. This Chapter would help the City maintain the levels required by the state mandate and achieve the City's goals of 75% landfill diversion by 2010 and zero waste by 2020. 
	J.	In keeping with the Precautionary Principle, codified in Chapter 1 of the Environment Code, this Chapter requires proper handling of construction debris as a deterrent to unsafe and wasteful practices. In this way, the City will create and maintain a healthy, viable environment for current and future generations, and will become a model of sustainability.

SEC. 1500.  FINDINGS. 
	The Board of Supervisors and Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco wish to authorize the creation of a Green Business program in order for the City to encourage and recognize businesses that demonstrate environmental leadership, exceed minimum regulatory requirements and take voluntary steps to conserve natural resources and prevent pollution. 
(Added by Ord. 21-06, File No. 051818, App. 2/3/2006) 
SEC. 1501.  GREEN BUSINESS PROGRAM. 
	In compliance with this ordinance, the Department of Public Health, the Department of the Environment and the Public Utilities Commission are authorized to form a joint program to develop and implement a City-wide Green Business program to encourage and recognize businesses that: conserve the use of natural resources, such as electricity, water and fuel; reduce, reuse, recycle and compost materials; reduce the use and generation of hazardous materials and hazardous waste; and take affirmative steps to prevent pollution. The City departments shall use the Association of Bay Area Government's Bay Area Green Business Program as a model and baseline for San Francisco's Green Business program and may use more stringent standards and criteria. In developing and implementing the program, the departments shall target various business sectors operating in the City and may consult with: relevant federal, State, and regional agencies, such as the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and Bay Area Air Quality Management District; City departments that issue permits and enforce regulatory programs, including the Department of Building Inspection, the Fire Department and the Port of San Francisco; governmental land owners; and other interested entities such as the Association of Bay Area Governments and San Francisco's Small Business Commission. Only operations in the City which are in compliance with all City contracts, City-issued permits and laws; and are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations are eligible to participate in the program. A Green Business recognition will be valid for up to one year from issuance and may be extended for up to two additional years based on self-certification of continuing qualification by the business. At the end of the qualification period, the business must reapply. A Green Business recognition automatically terminates upon a change in ownership or if the business ceases operation at that location. In coordination with and on behalf of the participating departments, the decision of the Director of the Department of the Environment on whether a business qualifies as a Green Business shall be final.

	In coordination with and on behalf of the participating departments, the Director of the Department of the Environment, after a public hearing, shall adopt and may amend guidelines, rules, regulations and forms to implement a Green Business recognition program for various business sectors, including the application process, eligibility criteria and qualification as a Green Business. Eligibility and qualifications shall include, without limitation, thresholds and standards for: recycling and waste reduction; energy conservation; water conservation; and pollution prevention in light of feasible resources and technologies. Prior to adoption or amendment of guidelines, rules or regulations, the Director of Public Health shall certify to the Director of the Department of the Environment that the guidelines, rules or regulations are consistent with local, state and federal environmental and health regulations and with the Department of Public Health's environmental and health objectives. The participating departments shall review eligibility and qualification criteria at least once every other year and the Director of the Department of the Environment shall amend the regulations as necessary.

The SFPUC has installed 2 megawatts of solar generating capacity as well as 4 megawatts of methane gas cogeneration capacity, which projects have bolstered the in-City renewable energy portfolio. In addition, the SFPUC is supplementing its renewable energy generation portfolio with 25 MW of purchased geothermal generation. 
	E.	The SFPUC is currently undertaking the development of additional large scale renewable energy generation assets within the City with the objectives of expanding and diversifying the renewable energy resources available to City departments and other SFPUC customers, boosting the City's clean energy industry and improving overall in-City energy reliability. However, there is a need for further initiatives to stimulate the growth in the City's supply of renewable energy. 
	F.	The SFPUC is pursuing the establishment of Community Choice Aggregation ("CCA") within the City. Implementation of CCA will allow the SFPUC to partner with private enterprise, leverage the purchasing power of a wider customer base and access the capital markets on a broader scale in order to expand its renewable energy generation asset portfolio. 
	G.	The Solar Task Force recommended implementation of a Solar Energy Incentive Program as one method to address this cost trend, in that an increase in private demand combined with appropriate measures to attract investment in the City's solar manufacturing and installation industries over the long term could reduce the overall cost of solar energy as costs of importing such manufacturing technology and installation expertise are reduced or eliminated and economies of scale are introduced to the in-City solar industry. 
	H.	A successful solar incentive program would increase the installation of solar power, thus providing greater supply during peak demand times during the day and improving the reliability of in-City generation capacity using clean solar energy. 
	I.	The development of a more efficient and cost-effective in-City solar manufacturing and installation industry over the long term would result in savings for the SFPUC's solar projects.
	J.	The City has established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. 
	K.	In view of the City's objectives in addressing the challenge of climate change, the positive benefits for the City's overall power consumption market and the particular benefits for the SF-PUC's Power Enterprise, the SFPUC intends to allocate certain power revenues previously budgeted to renewable energy development and energy efficiency projects towards funding the implementation of the solar incentive program described in this Chapter, with the objective of providing an appropriation of $2 million to $5 million annually over the ten years commencing with fiscal year 2008-2009. 
	L.	The City and the SFPUC intend this program to complement the SFPUC's renewable energy capital programs, including CCA, by attracting additional investment that will expand the development of renewable energy within the City and will spread the costs and risks of that development across a more diverse range of stakeholders. 
	M.	As a complement to this initiative the SFPUC, the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors intend to pursue the establishment of a stable rate structure for all of the SFPUC's power customers, which would enable the SFPUC to become a creditworthy bond issuer and to finance the City's own renewable energy development projects on a more advantageous tax-exempt basis.

SEC. 18.7.  SOLAR ENERGY INCENTIVE PILOT PROGRAM. 
Section 18.7-1. Findings. 
	A.	California has set a goal to create 3,000 megawatts (MW) of new, solar-produced electricity by 2017, moving the state toward a cleaner energy future and helping lower the cost of solar systems for consumers. 
	B.	The California Public Utilities Commission, through its California Solar Initiative (CSI), provides $2.2 Billion in incentives over the next decade for existing residential homes and existing and new commercial, industrial, and agricultural properties of which 10% will be set aside to assist installation of solar for low-income residents and affordable housing developments. 
	C.	On November 17, 2007, the CPUC adopted the CSI Single-Family Low-Income Incentive Program. The Single-Family Low-Income Incentive Program will provide incentives for solar PV systems from $4.75 to $7.00 per watt to qualifying low-income homeowners. The Program will also provide full-subsidy systems to very low-income households who financed their home through local, state and federal housing assistance programs and whose household income is at or below the 50 percent of the area median income. 
	D.	The CSI Single-Family Low-Income Program will not begin accepting applications until after a statewide Program Manager has been selected. A Request For Proposals for the CSI Single-Family Low-Income Program Manager was released on April 16th, 2008 and the final date for Proposal submission is May 28th, 2008. Once the Program Manager is selected, the Single-Family Low-Income Program will be implemented throughout the state of California and will assist applicants in determining their individual eligibility. 
	E.	Establishing a pilot program will enable the City to immediately implement this program and evaluate the effectiveness of the program and determine the best policy for allocation of public funds before deciding how or whether to continue the program.

SEC. 2301.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors finds that:
 	(a)	The City and County of San Francisco has a longstanding commitment to environmental sustainability through the prohibition of bottled water purchases by the San Francisco City and County Government, as instructed by Executive Directive 07-07.
 	(b)	The Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System operated by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission delivers pristine drinking water, which is stored in the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, meets or exceeds all federal and state criteria for drinking water quality, and is tested over 100,000 times per year.
	(c)	Bottled water is bad for the environment. More than one billion water bottles end up in California's trash each year  taking up valuable landfill space, leaking toxic chemicals such as phalates into the ground water, and taking 1,000 years to degrade. It takes an estimated 2,000 times more energy to produce bottled water than it does to produce an equivalent amount of tap water. Bottled water adds to greenhouse gas emissions because high amounts of oil are used to manufacture the plastic bottles, in addition to the emissions resulting from the transportation of the bottles to stores.
	(d)	Bottled water is expensive. Americans spent $10.6 billion on bottled water in 2009 and paid up to 1,000 times the cost of tap water.
	(e)	Bottled water is potentially a health hazard. A growing number of scientific studies are pointing to the harmful effects of chemicals in the plastic that can leach into the water and be consumed. Further, most branded bottled water companies do not disclose their water sources, treatment methods or contaminants found in the water.
	(f)	The City and County of San Francisco is dedicated to being a good environmental steward by promoting water conservation efforts and educating residents about the environmental, economic, and health benefits of drinking tap water.
