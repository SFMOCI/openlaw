SEC. 1A.1.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that: 
	(1)	Animals, including but not limited to chickens, pigeons, doves, ducks, guinea fowl, goats, sheep, dogs, cats and turtles are being sacrificed by groups and individuals in this City, using methods known to be unreliable and not humane and causing great fear, pain and needless injury and death to the animals being sacrificed; 
	(2)	Sacrificial animals are often subjected to inhumane treatment prior to being killed, in that they are kept in overcrowded and filthy conditions, are kept in close confinement and with animals not of their own species while awaiting sacrifice and are often deprived of food and water for days before being killed, possibly so that the animal does not defecate or urinate out of fear in the course of the sacrifice; 
	(3)	Stress and fear experienced by chickens, a commonly sacrificed animal, affects the chicken's immune system and increases growth of bacteria, especially salmonella, in the chicken's system, creating a human health hazard; 
	(4)	There is no reasonable means to guarantee that animals used in sacrifice are disease-free;
	(5)	Following the practice of animal sacrifice, animal remains are often left in public places;
	(6)	Improperly disposed-of animal remains present a serious public health hazard, in that areas where dead animals are left attract and become a harborage for flies, rats and fleas, thus increasing the likelihood of the spread of disease to other animals and to humans; 
	(7)	Flies attracted to animal remains are themselves known to transmit numerous human and animal diseases, including dysentery, typhoid, cholera, salmonella, salmonosis, infectious hepatitis and parasitic worms; 
	(8)	Rats are commonly associated with the spread of disease, including plague, Leptus Pyrosis and typhus;
	(9)	The sanitary disposal of the remains of sacrificial animals by the diverse individuals and groups practicing such rites cannot reasonably be monitored or controlled; 
	(10)	There is no guarantee that children are not exposed to animal sacrifice which may adversely affect the mental health and behavior of the child, to the detriment of both the child and the community; 
	(11)	This ban on animal sacrifice is imperative (1) to prevent cruelty to animals, (2) to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the community, and (3) to prevent the adverse psychological impact on children exposed to animal sacrifices; 
	(12)	This Article shall apply to any person, group, firm or corporation that kills, maims or sacrifices any animal in any type of ritual, or provides animals for that purpose.

	(d)	Notice of Vacation of Premises by Tubercular Patient. In case of vacation of any apartment or premises by the death or removal therefrom of a person having tuberculosis, it shall be the duty of the attending physician, or if there be no such physician, or if such physician be absent, of the owner, lessee, occupant or other person having charge of said apartment or premises, to notify the Director of Public Health of said death or removal within 24 hours thereafter; and such apartment or premises so vacated shall not be occupied until duly disinfected, cleaned, or renovated, as hereinafter provided. 
	Further, it shall be unlawful for any person suffering from tuberculosis to change his or her residence or to be removed therefrom until the Director of Public Health has been notified so that the vacated apartment or premises may be disinfected, cleaned, or renovated. 
	(e)	Disinfection of Premises. When notified of the vacation of any apartment or premises as provided in this Section, the Director of Public Health or one of his deputies shall thereafter visit said apartment or premises and shall order and direct that except for purposes of cleaning or disinfection no infected article shall be removed therefrom until property is suitably cleansed or disinfected, and said Director of Public Health or his deputy shall determine the manner in which said apartment or premises shall be disinfected, cleansed or renovated in order that they may be rendered safe and suitable for occupancy. After the health authorities determine that disinfection is sufficient to render them safe and suitable for occupancy, said apartment or premises, together with all infected articles therein, shall be immediately disinfected by the Director of Public Health; or if the owner prefers, by the owner at his expense to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Health. Should the Director of Public Health determine that such apartment or premises are in need of thorough cleansing of renovating, a notice to this effect shall be served upon the owner or agent of said premises, and said owner or agent shall proceed to the cleansing of renovating of said apartment or premises in accordance with the instructions of the Director of Public Health and such cleansing and renovating shall be done at the expense of said owner or agent. Such articles that cannot be disinfected or renovated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Health shall be destroyed.

This notice must not be removed under the penalty of the law except by the Director of Public Health or other duly authorized official." 
	(g)	Safe Disposal of Sputum, Etc. Any person having tuberculosis who shall dispose of his sputum, saliva or other bodily secretion or excretion so as to cause offense or danger to any person or persons occupying the same room or apartment, house or part of house, shall on complaint of any person subject to such offense or danger, be deemed guilty of a nuisance; and any person subject to such a nuisance may make complaint in writing to the Director of Public Health, and it shall be the duty of the Director of Public Health receiving such complaint to investigate and if it appears that the nuisance complained of is such as to cause offense or danger to any person occupying the same room, apartment, house or part of house, he shall serve a notice on the person so complained of, reciting the alleged cause of offense or danger and requiring him to dispose of his sputum, saliva or other bodily secretion or excretion in such a manner as to remove all reasonable cause of offense or danger. 
	It shall be the duty of a physician attending a patient for tuberculosis to take all proper precautions and to give proper instructions to provide for the safety of all individuals occupying the same house or apartment.

Such person shall not be permitted to leave such hospital or other institution until the danger of infection has been removed or he is able and willing to comply with the precautions and rules herein referred to. 
	(i)	Procedure and Precautions to Be Taken. It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Health to transmit to a physician reporting a case of tuberculosis as provided in this Section a printed statement and report naming such procedure and precautions as are necessary or desirable to be taken on the premises of a tubercular patient. Upon receipt of such statement or report, the physician shall carry into effect all such procedures and precautions as are therein prescribed, and shall thereupon sign and date the same, and return to the Director of Public Health without delay; or if such attending physician be unwilling or unable to carry into effect the procedure and precautions so specified, he shall so state on this report, and immediately return the same to the Director of Public Health and the duties therein prescribed shall thereupon devolve upon said Director of Public Health. Upon the receipt of this statement and report, the Director of Public Health shall examine the same and satisfy himself that the attending physician has taken all necessary and desirable precautions to insure the safety of all persons living in the apartment or premises occupied by the person having tuberculosis. If the precautions taken or instructions given by the attending physician are, in the opinion of the Director of Public Health, not such as will remove all reasonable danger or probability of danger to the persons occupying the same house or apartment or premises, the Director of Public Health shall return to the attending physician the report with a letter specifying the additional precautions or instructions which the Director of Public Health shall require him to make or give; and the said attending physician shall immediately take the additional precautions and give the additional instructions specified and shall record and return the same on the original report to the Director of Public Health. It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Health to transmit to every person reporting any case of tuberculosis, or if there be no attending physician, to the person reported as suffering from this disease, a circular of information which shall inform the consumptive of the precautions necessary to avoid transmitting the disease to others. 
	(j)	Violations. It shall be unlawful for any physician or person practicing as a physician to report knowingly as affected with tuberculosis any person who is not so affected or willfully make any false statement concerning the name, sex, color, occupation, place where last employed, if known, or address of any person reported as affected with tuberculosis, or certify falsely as to any of the precautions taken to prevent the spread of infection. 
	(k)	Children of School Age. No instructor, teacher, pupil or child affected with pulmonary tuberculosis shall be permitted by any superintendent, principal or teacher of any public, private or parochial school, to attend school except by written permission of the Director of Public Health.

	"In consideration of the granting of aid to me by the City and County of San Francisco, I hereby pledge, promise and agree to reimburse and repay said City and County all sums of money actually expended in my behalf or aid granted or given by the City and County of San Francisco for my care and maintenance, provided I am able to pay for the same in whole or in part, and I further agree that if any of said aid consists of care and treatment for injury sustained by me by reason of accident or wrongful act, the value of such aid shall be, if I assert or maintain a claim against another for damages on account of said injury, a lien upon any damages recovered, or to be recovered, either by judgment, settlement or compromise by myself, or by my heirs or personal representative in case of my death. 
	"I further agree that if and when I enter Laguna Honda Hospital or Hassler Hospital as a patient therein, I shall deposit in the Home Trust Fund an amount not less than the sum fixed for payment by toward cost of such institutional care as determined by my ability so to pay, and which sum I hereby expressly agree to pay; and I further agree that a direct charge against my Home Trust Fund account in that amount may be made by the said hospital at the completion of each month or portion of a month during the time I remain therein to discharge this obligation to pay, as aforesaid.

SEC. 124.5.  LIENS ON ACTIONS AGAINST THIRD PARTY.
	(a)	As used in this section:
		(1)	"Recipient" means any person who has received medical care or hospitalization or will be provided medical care or hospitalization rendered by the San Francisco Department of Public Health or the San Francisco Fire Department because of an injury for which another person may be liable. This term includes the recipient's guardian, conservator, other personal representative, estate, or survivors, including any heir, as defined in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 377, who is a party in a cause of action arising out of the death of the person who received the medical care or hospitalization. 
		(2)	"Action" means any cause of action demanding payment of damages filed in any court, or with any public agency, including but not limited to any application for compensation under the Workers Compensation Act of the California Labor Code, or with a private adjudicator, including but not limited to a private arbitrator or mediator, arising out of the injuries that resulted in the medical care or hospitalization of the recipient. This term also includes any cause of action arising out of the death of the recipient from such injuries. 
		(3)	"Claim" means any demand by the recipient for damages against another, including but not limited to any written demand by the recipient for payment under the provisions of any insurance contract providing for payment to injured persons, including payment from the recipient's insurance carrier or the third party's insurance carrier or both carriers. 
	(b)	When any recipient, as defined in Subsection (a)(1) of this section, asserts an action or claim for damages against a third party or insurance carrier based upon an injury requiring medical care, the cost of the medical care shall constitute a lien in favor of the City and County of San Francisco upon any such recovery received by the recipient. 
	(c)	When any recipient who has been billed for the cost of medical care rendered by the San Francisco Department of Public Health or the San Francisco Fire Department fails to pay in full for such care and asserts an action or claim for damages against a third party or insurance carrier, the recipient's attorney retained to assert the action or claim shall provide written notice of such action or claim by personal delivery or first-class mail to the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection in the Office of the Treasurer-Tax Collector within 10 days of asserting such action or claim. Such notice by the retained attorney to the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection shall adequately identify the recipient, and his or her action or claim, including the name of the insurance carrier against which claim has been made, or the court or state or local agency in which the action or claim is asserted, in order to allow the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection to prepare and file the lien as authorized by Subsection B of this section. In addition, if the recipient as defined in Subsection (a)(1) of this section does not retain an attorney to assert the action or claim, he or she shall give the same notice as described in this subsection. A mailed billing statement sent by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the San Francisco Fire Department or the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection to the address of the recipient as given on the medical records shall constitute prima facie evidence of knowledge by the recipient of such billing for medical care. 
	(d)	When the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection has perfected a lien upon a judgment, award, or settlement in favor of a recipient against any third party or third-party insurance carrier for an injury for which the recipient has received medical care from the San Francisco Department of Public Health or the San Francisco Fire Department, the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection as lien claimant shall be entitled to foreclose its lien against any proceeds from such judgment, award, or settlement to enforce payment of the lien against the third party or third-party insurance carrier, with interest at the legal rate. If the amount of such judgment, award, or settlement so recovered has been paid to the recipient, as defined in Subsection (a)(1) of this section, or to his or her attorney retained to assert the action or claim, the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection shall be entitled to foreclose its lien against the proceeds received by such recipient, recipient's agent, recipient's transferee, or against the retained attorney if he or she has received such payment, to the extent of the San Francisco Department of Public Health's or the San Francisco Fire Department's or the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection's lien, with interest at the legal rate. 
	(e)	The failure by the attorney retained by the recipient, as defined in Subsection (a)(1) of this section, to give notice to the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection in the Office of the Treasurer-Tax Collector regarding the recipient's action or claim for damages against a third party or insurance carrier after the recipient has received a billing for medical care from the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the San Francisco Fire Department or the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection shall constitute fraud and deceit by the retained attorney. Likewise, the failure by any recipient, as defined in Subsection (a)(1) of this section, to give such notice as described in this subsection after receiving a billing for medical care from the San Francisco Department of Public Health or by the recipient. In addition, either the recipient or the recipient's attorney retained to assert such action or claim who receives any payment from the third party or insurance carrier resulting from the assertion of such action or claim and who fails to apply such payment toward the satisfaction of the outstanding bill for medical care shall be liable as a constructive trustee for all damages that may be awarded by any court to the City and County of San Francisco for breach of constructive trustee duties and responsibilities. 
	(f)	Commencing 30 days after the enactment of this ordinance, the affected medical facilities of the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Francisco Fire Department shall make every reasonable effort where feasible to include a statement in English, Spanish, and Chinese with every billing setting out the notice requirement, as described in Subsection (c) of this section, imposed on the recipient's retained attorney, or if there is no retained attorney, imposed on the recipient, regarding any action or claim for recovery asserted against a third party or insurance carrier. The statement shall read: 
	"IMPORTANT: If your attorney or you alone demand money from another person or insurance company because of your injuries and you have not paid this bill in full, your attorney or you must notify: The Bureau of Delinquent Revenue Collection, City Hall, Room 107, San Francisco, California 94102. Failure to notify the Bureau within 10 days of making your demand may result in civil liability for your attorney or you. S.F. Health Code Section 124.5."

SEC. 129.  CHARITY CARE POLICY REPORTING AND NOTICE REQUIREMENT.
	Declaration of policy. It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco that charity care-medical care provided to those who cannot afford to pay and without expectation of reimbursement-is a vital portion of community health care services. While San Francisco General Hospital is the primary provider of charity care services in San Francisco, private hospitals also have a responsibility to serve uninsured and poor patients. Nonprofit hospitals in particular have an obligation to provide community benefits in the public interest in exchange for favorable tax treatment by the government. It is essential that, on an ongoing basis, the City and County of San Francisco evaluate the need for charity care in the community given the City's responsibility to provide care to indigents. To plan for the continuing fulfillment of this responsibility, the City needs information from the hospitals in San Francisco on each hospital's policies on the availability of and criteria for charity care. For planning purposes, the City also needs information on the amount of charity care provided by each hospital. Upon receipt of such information, the City can better fulfill its mandate to provide care to indigents and fashion an appropriate response to unmet needs for charity care including the recommendation of budgetary, regulatory or other action at the State and Federal levels. 
	To maximize the access to charity care within the community and to enhance the health of the public by informing individuals of the availability of charity care, it is further the policy of the City and County of San Francisco that each hospital notify patients of that hospital's policies on charity care. Such notice shall include visually prominent multilingual postings explaining the hospital's policy on charity care. It shall also be the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to require hospitals, when practicable, to verbally notify patients at the time of admission as to the availability of charity care and the process for applying or qualifying for such care.

	It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, or aid in removing, the body of any deceased person from the place where the death of such person has occurred unless permission to remove said body has been granted by the Director of Public Health, or unless a regularly licensed physician who has been in attendance upon the deceased for not less than 24 hours next prior to death shall have certified that the death was not directly or indirectly the result of criminal causes, and that it did not occur under circumstances making the death reportable to the Coroner. 
	It shall be unlawful to move from the position or place of death the body of any person who died under circumstances making such death reportable to the Coroner except with permission of the Coroner, unless said body is directly in the public view, or unless death occurred in a hospital where the person had been taken for treatment of the condition which caused death in which case said body may be moved to another place in the same hospital. 
	It shall be unlawful for any person, except upon authorization by the Coroner or Department of Public Health, to dispose of or in any manner to aid in the disposal of, whether by burial, dissection or otherwise, the body or parts thereof of any persons whose death has resulted from the performance or an effort to perform a criminal abortion. 
	It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain, or induce or assist others in obtaining or attempting to secure, from the proper authorities any permit to inter, remove or otherwise dispose of the remains of any deceased person unless the person desiring such permit presents to the Department of Public Health a certificate of death which clearly and truthfully shows the name and age of decedent and the precise location where the death occurred; if the same has been caused by criminal abortion, either as a direct or indirect consequence, the certificate shall so state. 
SEC. 186.  DUTY TO REPORT DEATH TO CORONER.

		When said report is filed and sufficient reasons are not given why cremation should not take place, the Director of Public Health shall issue a written permit for the cremation. 
		A permit shall not be given to cremate a body upon which a Coroner's inquest is pending until the cause of death has been attested by the proper authority-except any part of a body, or the contents of a body proposed to be cremated may be removed and preserved as evidence, the same as in the case of interment, and when such parts or contents are removed the body may be cremated.

When death resulted from a contagious disease a special permit to remove and cremate may be issued by the Department of Public Health. 
		Provided, that in case of death from any cause whatever, a special permit may be issued by the Department of Public Health, to remove and cremate a body at any time.

[Smokeless Tobacco Warnings.]
SEC. 264.  POLICY.
	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to require every person who sells smokeless tobacco to post a conspicuous warning at the point of retail sale as to the addictive and possible cancer-causing nature of smokeless tobacco, the illegality of, and the punishment for selling, giving, or in any way furnishing smokeless tobacco, or any other tobacco product or paraphernalia, to another person who is under the age of 18 years. 
(Added by Ord. 329-87, App. 7/31/87)
SEC. 264.1.  FINDINGS.
	Scientific evidence has shown that use of smokeless tobacco is causally related to oral cancer with the risk of developing such cancers being four times as great among snuff users than nonusers. Smokeless tobacco has been shown to contain nicotine which is a dependence-producing drug that frequently results in addictive behavior. Scientific evidence has shown that smokeless tobacco has been associated with a number of oral problems including gingivitis, gingival recession, tooth abrasion and caries. The use of smokeless tobacco has increased substantially in recent years particularly among adolescent males, and is highly prevalent among certain population groups. Users generally are unaware of the possible harmful effects associated with using smokeless tobacco. 
	Therefore, the Board of Supervisors declares that it is in the public interest to require every person who sells smokeless tobacco to post a conspicuous warning at the point of retail sale as to the addictive and possible cancer-causing nature of smokeless tobacco, the illegality of, and the punishment for selling, giving or in any way furnishing smokeless tobacco, or any other tobacco product or paraphernalia, to another person who is under 18 years.

	(c)	"Smokeless tobacco" shall mean any finely cut, ground, powdered, or leaf tobacco that is not intended to be smoked.
	(d)	"Snuff" shall mean any finely cut, ground, or powdered tobacco that is not intended to be smoked.
(Added by Ord. 329-87, App. 7/31/87)
SEC. 264.3.  SMOKELESS TOBACCO WARNINGS.
	Every person who sells, offers for sale, or keeps for sale, smokeless tobacco shall post at the point of retail sale, that is a place within close proximity of the shelves or other area where smokeless tobacco is displayed for consumer purchase, a conspicuous warning sign as provided in this section. Such sign shall be not less than eight inches by 11 inches in size and shall be printed on a contrasting background and in a legible manner, conveying the following warning: 
"WARNING: SMOKELESS TOBACCO IS NOT
A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES.
IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL, GIVE, OR IN
ANY WAY FURNISH SMOKELESS
TOBACCO, OR ANY OTHER TOBACCO
PRODUCT, OR PARAPHERNALIA, TO A
PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS. 
A VIOLATION OF THIS LAW IS A
MISDEMEANOR."

(Added by Ord. 329-87, App. 7/31/87)
SEC. 264.4.  PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.
	(a)	The Director of Health shall enforce Section 264.3 against violations by serving notice requiring the correction of any violation within a reasonable time specified by the Director. Upon failure to comply with the notice within the time period specified, the Director shall call upon the City Attorney to maintain an action for injunction to enforce the provisions of Section 264.3, to cause the correction of any such violation, and for assessment and recovery of a civil penalty for such violation. 
	(b)	Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, society, group or other person or legal entity that violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or resists, or opposes the execution of Section 264.3, shall be liable for a civil penalty, not to exceed $500 for each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue, which penalty shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the City and County of San Francisco, by the City Attorney, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any penalty assessed and recovered in a civil action brought pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco. 
	(c)	Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, society, group or other person or legal entity that violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists, or opposes the execution of any of the provisions of Section 264.3, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500, or by imprisonment, not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for every day such violation, disobedience, omission, neglect or refusal shall continue. 
	(d)	For a second or subsequent violation, any local retail business license of the business facility where the offense occurred shall be revoked by the licensing agency until the violator complies with Section 264.3. 
(Added by Ord. 329-87, App. 7/31/87)
[Alcohol Consumption Warnings.]
SEC. 265.  POLICY.
	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to require every person who sells alcohol intended to be used as a beverage to post a conspicuous warning at the point of retail sale warning that drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause birth defects. 
(Added by Ord. 6-88, App. 1/7/88)
SEC. 265.1.  FINDINGS.
	Recent research indicates that alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have severe and adverse effects on the fetus, resulting in birth defects including growth retardation, facial abnormalities and congenital heart disease. Such adverse effects are known individually as Fetal Alcohol Effects and collectively as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading preventable birth defect in infants, affecting brain, limb and motor reflex development for developing fetuses. These are irreversible birth defects. Public awareness of Fetal Alcohol Effects and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is dangerously low. It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco that the public should be informed that consumption of alcohol during pregnancy may be harmful to a fetus and may result in birth defects. 
	Therefore, the Board of Supervisors declares that it is in the public interest to require every person who sells alcohol intended to be used as a beverage to post a conspicuous warning at the point of retail sale as to the possible danger in consuming alcohol during pregnancy. 
(Added by Ord. 6-88, App. 1/7/88)
SEC. 265.2.  ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WARNINGS.
	(a)	Every person who sells, offers for sale, or keeps for sale, alcohol intended to be used as a beverage shall post at the point of retail sale a warning as provided in this Section. 
	(b)	Such sign shall be not less than 10 inches by 10 inches in size and shall be conspicuously displayed so as to be readable; except that for persons who sell, offer for sale, or keep for sale, alcohol intended to be used as a beverage in "mini-bars," which are small refrigerators which do not exceed 2 feet in height by 2 feet in width, the required warning signs at the point of retail sale shall be not less than 3½ inches by 4½ inches in size and shall be readable. The signs required for "mini-bars" shall be attached and secured by adhesive material to the inside door of the "mini-bars." Lettering thereon shall be not less than  inch in height and shall be printed on a contrasting background and in a legible manner, conveying the following warning: 
"WARNING: DRINKING DISTILLED
SPIRITS, BEER, COOLERS, WINE AND
OTHER ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
DURING PREGNANCY CAN CAUSE
BIRTH DEFECTS" 
	(c)	Where alcohol intended to be used as a beverage is sold, offered for sale or kept for sale to a substantial number of persons who use a language other than English as a primary language, an additional sign shall be worded in the primary language or languages involved and posted pursuant to Paragraph (b). 
(Added by Ord. 6-88, App. 1/7/88; amended by Ord. 87-89, App. 3/29/89)
SEC. 265.3.  PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.
	(a)	The Director of Health shall enforce Section 265.2 against violations by serving notice requiring the correction of any violation within a reasonable time specified by the Director. Upon failure to comply with the notice within the time period specified, the Director shall call upon the City Attorney to maintain an action for injunction to enforce the provisions of Section 265.2, to cause the correction of any such violation, and for assessment and recovery of a civil penalty for such violation. 
	(b)	Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, society, group or other person or legal entity that violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with the execution of Section 265.2, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue. 
	(c)	Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, society, group or other person or legal entity that violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with the execution of any of the provisions of Section 265.2 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500, or by imprisonment, not exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment, and shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for every day such violation, disobedience, omission, neglect or refusal shall continue. 
	(d)	For a second or subsequent violation, any local retail business license of the business facility where the offense occurred may be revoked by the licensing agency until the violator complies with Section 265.2. 
(Added by Ord. 6-88, App. 1/7/88)
SEC. 266.  REGISTRY FOR SENIOR AND DISABLED PERSONS WHO WISH TO BE CONTACTED IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER.
	The Department of Public Health shall establish and maintain a register identifying those persons who wish to be visited after a major earthquake or other disaster which poses a threat of injury to such persons. The persons eligible to register are those 65 years of age or older, those who are disabled, and those who employ or house persons who are eligible to register. A "disabled person" is one whose life functions have been significantly altered by their medical condition or disease, or who has any other significantly disabling physical, or mental condition including, but not limited to, a physical condition that significantly impairs his or her ability to move normally, a chronic illness that requires continuing medication to prevent a life-threatening disease, or a condition (such as heart disease) that could result in a serious medical problem in a disaster. Persons who wish to be included in the register shall provide their name, address, telephone number and the names, addresses and telephone numbers of any relatives, neighbors, or other persons who regularly communicate with the person registered and may be able to provide information as to that person's condition in the event of a disaster. In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster which poses a threat of injury to senior and disabled persons, the Department shall attempt to visit or otherwise communicate with registered persons in order to determine if they need medical or other assistance. The Department shall act as expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration the need to allocate resources to respond to the disaster. The Department shall provide notice to the public that registration is available by such means as the Department determines best suited to reach seniors and the disabled. 
	By adopting this ordinance, the City and County of San Francisco is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not assuming, not is it imposing on its officers and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach approximately caused injury. 
(Added by Ord. 259-90, App. 7/6/90)
[Natural Membrane (Lambskin) Condom Warning.]
SEC. 267.  POLICY.
	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to require every person who sells condoms made of natural membrane (lambskin) intended to be used for disease or pregnancy prevention to post a conspicuous warning at the point of retail sale, display for purchase, or dispensing of condoms that latex condoms labeled for disease prevention provide greater protection against AIDS, Hepatitis B and Herpes viruses than do natural (lambskin) condoms. 
(Added by Ord. 381-91, App. 10/28/91)
SEC. 267.1.  FINDINGS.
	Recent testing of natural membrane (lambskin) condoms revealed that this type of condom prevents the passage of sperm through the pores of the material, but some viruses and virus-sized particles pass through the barrier membrane. This research indicates that users cannot be assured that natural membrane condoms will be a barrier against all sexually transmitted diseases. Based on research conducted that studied the effectiveness of condoms made of latex and condoms made of natural membrane in preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, the Food and Drug Administration, of the Department of Health and Human Services, released an educational publication ("Condoms and Sexually Transmitted Disease," 1990) that states: "Tests have shown that latex condoms can prevent the passage of AIDS, hepatitis and herpes viruses but natural (lambskin) condoms may not do this." 
	Therefore, in order to serve the public health, safety and welfare, the Board of Supervisors declares that the purpose of Sections 267 through 267.6 of this Article is to educate the public by requiring that warning signs be placed at all locations where condoms made of natural membrane (lambskin) are sold to the public. 
(Added by Ord. 381-91, App. 10/28/91)
SEC. 267.2.  DUTY TO POST.
	(a)	Every person or entity who owns, operates, manages, leases or rents a premises or vending machine offering condoms made of natural membrane (lambskin) for sale, or dispensing for consideration, to the public, shall cause a sign or notice to be posted at one of the following points: the point of sale, display for purchase, distribution, or dispensing. Such notice shall be in English, Spanish, Chinese and Tagalog as provided in this section: 
	The sign or notice shall read:

		(2)	Where the sale or dispensing of condoms made of natural membrane to the public occurs through the use of a vending machine, the sign or notice and the lettering thereon is not subject to the minimum width, height or length requirements of this Subsection (b) of this Section except at least one sign or notice shall be attached or affixed to the front of the vending machine to assure that it is readable by a person who is physically close enough to the vending machine to actually operate it. 
	(d)	It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors in approving these provisions that the specified warning notices shall be provided by the Department of Public Health to facilitate compliance with the requirements.

[Personal Lubricants Intended to Be Used with Condoms Warning.]
SEC. 267.7.  POLICY.
	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to require every person who sells personal lubricants intended to be used with condoms to post a conspicuous warning at the point of retail sale or display for purchase that lubricants containing oil or vegetable shortening used with a latex condom may damage the integrity of the condom, water-based lubricants are condom compatible, and lubricants containing nonoxynol-9 may decrease transmission of STD's and HIV when used with a condom. 
(Added by Ord. 225-93, App. 7/16/93)
SEC. 267.8.  FINDINGS.
	Testing of short-term exposure to lubricants adjunctly applied to latex condoms concluded that oil-based personal lubricants have a significant deleterious effect on the strength of condoms. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, issued a report ("Condoms for Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Diseases," 1988) that recommends that only water-based lubricants should be used with a condom. Petroleum- or oil-based lubricants (such as petroleum jelly, cooking oils, shortening, and lotions) should not be used since they weaken the latex. This report indicates that use of oil-based lubricants that weaken latex may contribute to the failure of condoms to protect against STD.

	"Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to dispose of refuse as defined in this ordinance except as herein provided, save that the provisions of this ordinance shall not include refuse which may be incinerated by an owner of a building for himself or for his tenants on the premises where produced; provided, however, that such incineration shall be subject to inspection and control by the Director of Public Health and the Fire Department. Failure of any householder producing refuse to subscribe to and pay for refuse collection, unless such householder is a tenant for whom refuse collection service is provided by his landlord, shall be prima facie evidence that such householder is disposing of refuse in violation of this ordinance. 
	"Section 3. Refuse consisting of waste or discarded food, animal and vegetable matter, discharged containers, of food, animal and vegetable matter and ashes shall be collected and placed in suitable metal cans of such capacity as the Director of Public Works may prescribe (but not to exceed 32 gallons in the case of a can serving one single family dwelling unit) by the producer or landlord who by reason of contract or lease with an occupant is obligated to care for such refuse, for collection by a refuse collector to be disposed of as herein provided. Waste paper and boxes and other refuse materials not subject to putrefaction or decay, and cuttings from trees, lawns and gardens may be placed in any suitable container and delivered by the producer or landlord, who by reason of contract or lease with the occupant is obligated to care for such refuse and deliver same to a refuse collector, to be disposed as herein provided; provided, however, that it shall be optional with the producer or landlord to deliver waste paper or other refuse having a commercial value to a refuse collector, and the producer or landlord may dispose of the same in any manner he may see fit. (Refuse which under the provisions hereof must be deposited in a metal can of suitable capacity shall be removed daily from the place where the same is created.) 
	"Section 4. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation, other than a refuse collector licensed by the Director of Public Health as in the ordinance provided, to transport through the streets of the City and County of San Francisco any refuse as in this ordinance defined, or to collect or to dispose of the same, except waste paper, or other refuse having a commercial value." 
*   * 
	"Person, firms or corporations desiring to transport through the streets of the City and County of San Francisco only waste paper or other refuse having commercial value, and to collect and dispose of same need not obtain a permit therefor under the provisions of this ordinance." 
	"Section 11. Disputes over charges made by collectors or as to the character of the service performed shall be decided by the Director of Public Health. Any charges made in excess of rates fixed pursuant to this ordinance, when determined by the Director of Public Health, shall be refunded to the person or persons who paid the excess charge. 
	"Section 12. A refuse collector shall be entitled to payment for the collection of refuse at the end of each month from each householder or landlord served by him and from whom the payment is due." 
	"Section 14. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment in the County Jail for not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

SEC. 291.2.  FAILURE TO INITIATE SERVICE, MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SERVICE, OR TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT REFUSE CONTAINERS.
	When an owner fails to initiate adequate refuse collection service within 15 days of occupancy of a Dwelling or commercial property by any person, including a business entity, or fails to maintain adequate refuse collection service, the Director will evaluate the need for service and what would constitute adequate service in this context, and, where appropriate, give the Owner an order from the Director that such service or additional service is required. In determining the need for service or additional service, the Director may make use of any relevant information or evidence, including information provided by the Collector regarding the existing level of service. A copy of the Director's order will be sent to the Collector. If the Owner does not arrange with the Collector for service within 15 days from the date of mailing of the order, or request within that time a hearing before the Director to dispute a service or change of service requirement, then the Collector shall, consistent with the Director's order, initiate, maintain, or increase refuse collection service for said dwelling or commercial property. 
	When in the judgment of the Director additional refuse containers are required, they shall be provided by the Owner upon written notification from the Director. 
	The Director, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and after a public notice and hearing, may adopt forms, regulations, and guidelines to ensure the payment and collection of refuse services from any commercial property managers who fail to initiate or maintain sufficient refuse service, including standards and criteria for determining whether a Commercial property has provided for sufficient refuse service, or to otherwise implement and enforce Sections 291 et seq.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Director delegates authority to the Department of Public Works to implement and enforce Sections 291 et seq., the Department of Public Works may elect to assess, enforce, and collect administrative penalties in accordance with Section 39-1 of the Police Code.
	No person who is the owner, tenant, manager, employee, contractor, or visitor of a multifamily dwelling or of a multi-tenant commercial property shall be subject to fines or penalties for failure to provide adequate refuse collection service, unless and until the Director has adopted specific regulations establishing the responsibilities of such persons under this Article. 
	The fine for any violation at a dwelling or commercial property which generates less than one cubic yard of refuse per week may not initially exceed $100. 
	In addition to any administrative penalty assessed pursuant to this Article, the Director may assess the responsible Owner the reasonable enforcement costs incurred by the City, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The imposition of enforcement costs is within the discretion of the Director.

When the Owner has been directed to initiate service but fails to provide an adequate container or containers at an accessible location and the Collector attempts to collect refuse from the dwelling or commercial property, then such attempt shall be deemed the rendering of collection service for which Collector is entitled to compensation in the same manner and amount as if refuse had actually been collected. Should there be failure to make payment for any service rendered to any dwelling by the Collector, or rendered to a commercial property pursuant to an order of the Director of Public Health under Section 291.2, the means for effecting payment shall be in accordance with the procedure set forth hereunder.

	(a)	The Director shall, regardless of any sale or other transfer of property, process payment to the Collector for 1) nonpayment of a residential refuse collection charge, or 2) nonpayment of a commercial refuse collection charge incurred after an order from the Director requiring commercial refuse collection service. The Director shall process these payments from a continuing appropriation account so provided herein under Section 291.14, and the Owner shall be liable to the City for fees paid. The payment by the City will, upon the recording thereof in the manner herein provided, create a lien on the real property to which the service was rendered. The lien will be officially recorded in the County Recorder's files, the lien to carry and will include additional charges for administrative expenses of $87 for residential liens and $127 for commercial liens, or 10 percent of the amount owed, whichever is higher, plus any applicable recording fees, and interest at a rate of 1½ percent per full month compounded monthly from the date of the recordation of the lien on all fees and charges due. The Owner shall be notified by the Director that the fees and charges are due to the City. In addition, the Owner shall be notified that if the fees and charges remain unpaid, subsequent proceedings may be taken to make said fees and charges a special assessment on the real property to which said refuse collection service was rendered. 
	(b)	Beginning with fiscal year 2010-2011, fees set forth in this Section may be adjusted each year, without further action by the Board of Supervisors, as set forth in this Section. 
		Not later than April 1, the Director shall report to the Controller the revenues generated by the fees for the prior fiscal year and the prior fiscal year's costs of operation, as well as any other information that the Controller determines appropriate to the performance of the duties set forth in this Section. 
		Not later than May 15, the Controller shall determine whether the current fees have produced or are projected to produce revenues sufficient to support the costs of providing the services for which the fees are assessed and that the fees will not produce revenue that is significantly more than the costs of providing the services for which the fees are assessed. 
		The Controller shall, if necessary, adjust the fees upward or downward for the upcoming fiscal year as appropriate to ensure that the program recovers the costs of operation without producing revenue which is significantly more than such costs. The adjusted rates shall become operative on July 1.

[Nutrition Information Disclosure Requirements]*
SEC. 468.  PURPOSE.
	The purpose of Sections 468 through 468.8 is to provide consumers with information about the nutritional components of Food prepared, purchased, and eaten outside the home. Consumers must have basic nutritional information readily available in order to make informed choices about the Food that they, and their children and dependants, eat. These sections require Chain Restaurants to provide consumers with specific nutritional information on Menu Items, such as calorie content, so that consumers may be better able to make nutritional choices consistent with their health needs. Furthermore, ensuring informed food choices supports societal public health goals of preventing obesity, diabetes, and other avoidable nutrition-related diseases. 
(Added by Ord. 347-86, App. 8/15/86; Ord. 40-08, File No. 071661, App. 3/24/2008)
SEC. 468.1.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares as follows: 
	Chronic diseases and obesity are concurrent, serious and growing public health crises affecting states and localities across the country. In California and the City and County of San Francisco, the two epidemics are among the greatest public health challenges, as evidenced by the following: 
		•  Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, asthma, are the leading cause of death and disability in San Francisco and California; 
		•  Seventy percent of all U.S. deaths are attributable to chronic disease; 
		•  Hypertension and diabetes are the leading reasons for San Francisco Department of Public Health primary care clinic visits; 
		•  Obesity rates have doubled in children and tripled in teenagers over the past twenty years; 
		•  The rate at which obesity is increasing in California is among the fastest in the country; 
		•  One-third of California children, one-fourth of California teenagers, and one-half of California adults are either overweight or obese; 
		•  Fifty percent of overweight children and teenagers remain overweight as adults; 
		•  Over half of Californians are at greater risk for heart disease, type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, arthritis-related disabilities, depression, sleep disorders, and some cancers because of increasing obesity rates; 
		•  In San Francisco, 43% percent of adults are overweight or obese and 24% of school-age children are overweight or obese. 
	The burden of increasing overweight and obesity and accompanying chronic diseases manifests itself in premature death and disability, health care costs, and lost productivity. Obesity greatly increases the risk of chronic diseases such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma, and type-2 diabetes. 22% of San Franciscans have high blood pressure and 6.5% of San Franciscans have diabetes. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in San Francisco. The financial cost of chronic disease and obesity is evidenced by the following: 
		•  Health care costs rose nearly two billion dollars in inflation adjusted dollars between 1987 and 2000. Fifteen conditions including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease accounted for more than half the overall growth; 
		•  Medicare costs for those who were obese when they were middle aged are roughly twice as great as those who were at ideal weight; 
		•  In 2005, California's costs related to obesity; overweight, and lack of physical activity were projected to reach $28 billion for health care and lost work productivity; 
		•  The indirect and direct costs of adult obesity in America are between $69 and $117 billion each year; 
		•  If 10% of currently obese or overweight Californians were to reach and maintain a healthy weight over a five-year period, savings would amount to $13 billion; 
		•  Obesity-related expenditures are thought to have accounted for more than 25% of the increase in national health care spending between 1987 and 2001; 
		•  The San Francisco Department of Public Health estimates that the obesity epidemic costs San Francisco $192 million a year in medical expenses, lost productivity and workers' compensation. The estimated costs to the Department for diabetes for the year 2005 was $25 million. 
	The rise in obesity rates has coincided with Americans eating more meals outside of the home. Such meals contribute to the growing rate of obesity, as evidenced by the following: 
		•  In 1970, Americans spent just 26% of their food dollars on restaurant meals and other foods prepared outside the home. Today, Americans spend 47.9% of their food dollars on away-from-home foods; 
		•  Between 1972 and 1997, the per capita number of fast-food restaurants doubled, and the per-capita number of full-service restaurants rose by 35%; 
		•  The increase in per capita restaurants accounts for 65% of the increase in the percentage of those who are obese; 
		•  About one-third of the calories in an average American's diet come from restaurant or other away-from-home foods; 
		•  On average, children and youth aged 11-18 visit fast food outlets of twice a week; 
		•  Studies have shown a positive association between eating out and higher caloric intakes and higher body weights; 
		•  Children eat almost twice as many calories (770) when they eat a meal at a restaurant as they do when they eat at home (420); 
		•  Restaurant foods are generally higher in those nutrients for which over consumption is a problem, such as fat and saturated fat, and lower in nutrients required for good health, such as calcium and fiber; 
		•  It is not uncommon for a restaurant entree to provide half of a day's calories, saturated and trans fat, or sodium; 
		•  Portion sizes are often large at restaurants and people tend to eat greater quantities of food when they are served more, whether or not they are hungry; 
		•  Observational studies have shown that people who frequently consume food away from home tend to weigh more. 
	Without nutrition information, consumers consistently underestimate the nutritional content of restaurant foods, as evidenced by the following: 
		•  In a California field poll about the nutritional value of typical fast food and restaurant menu items, not a single respondent was able to answer all four questions correctly. Less than 1% answered three out of four questions correctly, and only 5% answered two out of four questions correctly. Nearly 68% were not able to answer a single question correctly; 
		•  An FDA-commissioned report concluded that without access to nutritional information, consumers are not able to assess the caloric content of foods; 
		•  One study illustrated that restaurant foods contain almost twice the number of calories estimated by consumers; 
		•  Another study showed that even trained nutrition professionals consistently underestimate the calorie content of restaurant foods by 200 to 600 calories; 
		•  The public's knowledge of the nutritional content of restaurant foods is incomplete, especially compared to pre-packaged foods. Moreover, the fact that chain restaurants' serving sizes are so varied and large, and their prices are so low, can mislead and even deceive the public regarding the amount of an actual serving size and how many calories a portion contains. 
	When nutrition information is provided, consumers use it to make healthier choices, as evidenced by the following: 
		•  Three-quarters of American adults report using nutritional labels on packaged foods; 
		•  Studies show that the use of food labels is associated with eating more healthful dies; 
		•  Almost half of consumers report that the information provided on food labels has caused them to change their mind about buying a food product; 
		•  With nutrition information, consumers are 24%-37% less likely to select high-calorie items. 
	The Federal Nutrition Labeling and Education Act requires food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on nearly all packaged foods, but explicitly exempts restaurants from that requirement. 
	The current system of voluntary nutritional disclosures by restaurants is inadequate. Approximately two-thirds of the largest chain restaurants fail to provide any nutritional information about their menu item to customers. Those that do provide such information often do not do so at the point of sale, but rather on websites or in brochures available only by request. 
	Competition within the food service industry is healthy and desirable but cannot lead to healthier food options when consumers are not able to make choices based upon the nutritional value of the food offered. 
84% of Californians are in favor of nutritional labeling in restaurants. The United States Surgeon General, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Academies' Institute of Medicine, and the American Medical Association have all recommended nutritional labeling of restaurant food as a strategy to address rising obesity rates. 
	The aforementioned findings are based on studies referenced in the "Statement of Legislative Findings," a copy of which is on file with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors in File No. ____________ and is incorporated herein by reference. 
	Therefore, it is the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this ordinance to provide consumers with basic nutritional information about prepared Foods sold at Chain Restaurants so that consumers can make informed Food choices; and to foster fairness and encourage beneficial competition among the Chain Restaurants of the City and County of San Francisco.

[Healthy Food Incentives Ordinance]*
SEC. 471.1.  FINDINGS.
	1.	In the last thirty-five years, obesity has grown into a public health problem of epidemic proportions. Seventy-three million Americans are obese according to a 2010 report issued by the CDC – an increase of 2.4 million from 2007. At least 17 percent of American children ages 2-19 years are now considered overweight or obese. An additional 17 percent are identifiably at risk of becoming overweight. Since the 1970s, obesity rates have doubled among preschool children ages 2-5 years and adolescents aged 12-19 years, and more than tripled among children aged 6-11 years. 
	2.	In 2008, approximately 29 percent of 5th graders, 26 percent of 7th graders, and 25 percent of 9th graders in San Francisco had weights above the healthy fitness zone range of the California Department of Education fitnessgram assessment. 
	3.	Obesity, overweight, and unhealthy eating habits pose a serious risk to the health and welfare of San Francisco's children and adolescents. Children and adolescents who are obese or overweight have an increased risk of being obese or overweight as adults, with 75 percent of children who are overweight expected to be overweight as adults. 
	4.	Childhood obesity also increases children's chances of experiencing chronic health problems later in life. During childhood and adolescence, obese and overweight individuals are already more likely than their peers to exhibit risk factors for heart disease (including elevated cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, and blood pressure), risk factors for cancer, and impaired glucose tolerance, a precursor for development of Type 2 diabetes. In recent years, Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents has risen dramatically in conjunction with increases in obesity and overweight. 
	5.	The Institute of Medicine has found that the prevalence of obesity among children is so great that it may reduce the life expectancy of the current generation of children and diminish the overall quality of their lives. 
	6.	Childhood obesity and overweight also have serious economic costs. Nationally, the annual costs of providing inpatient treatment to children diagnosed with obesity increased from $125.9 million in 2001 to $237.6 million in 2005. In addition to inpatient treatment, an estimated $14.1 billion is spent nationally on prescription drug, emergency room, and outpatient visit expenses each year as a result of childhood obesity and overweight. About 7 percent of San Francisco Public Health Department's unreimbursed medical payments are attributable to obesity among San Franciscans. As children and adolescents in San Francisco become adults, their high rates of obesity and overweight are likely to contribute to the already high economic costs of healthcare and loss of productivity associated with adult obesity in San Francisco. 
	7.	San Francisco has invested considerable resources to combat childhood obesity, offering a wide range of community programs. Shape Up San Francisco, a multidisciplinary government coalition, provides an annual Walking Challenge, a Safe Routes to School program to encourage children to walk or bike to school, and the Rethink Your Drink marketing campaign to discourage soda consumption. The San Francisco WIC program also has a Healthy Eating, Active Living campaign to increase WIC families' access to fresh, healthy food. Despite these measures, childhood obesity rates continue to rise and concern San Franciscans. 
	8.	San Francisco parents identify childhood obesity as a significant concern for their families. A 2003 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly all Bay Area adults said that being overweight or obese was a significant problem currently faced by children and teens, with 69 percent of adults describing it as major problem. In 2006, 21 percent of Bay Area parents in the Bay Area Parent Poll reported being somewhat or very concerned about their child's weight. The 2007 Bay Area Parent Poll showed that 26 percent of parents picked weight as their primary concern for their children- the second highest primary concern, after stress. 
	9.	San Francisco families want their children to have access to healthy, nutritional food and to make healthy choices from the food available. The 2003 survey by the Kaiser Foundation found that approximately 70 percent of Bay Area parents consider nutritional value to be very important when buying food for their household. In addition, the survey showed that 42 percent of Bay Area adults felt that the food industry has a significant responsibility in addressing obesity. 
	10.	San Francisco families also face limited time to obtain and prepare nutritional food, making dining out an appealing and often necessary option. The 2003 Kaiser Foundation study showed that 40 percent of Bay Area parents said that their child ate at least one fast food meal or snack on a typical day. More San Franciscans are eating out at least several times a week, with 14 percent of Bay Area parents reporting that their child did not eat dinner cooked at home on most nights in 2003. Fifty-seven percent of Bay Area parents said their child eats out at a restaurant at least once a week, and 14 percent of Bay Area parents said their child eats out at a restaurant between two and seven days a week. 
	11.	The food that children and adolescents consume at restaurants has a significant impact on their risk of developing obesity, overweight, or other related health risks. Studies have shown a positive association between eating out and higher caloric intakes and higher body weights. Research shows that consumption of fast food, sugar-sweetened beverages, and other restaurant offerings by children and adolescents is frequently associated with overeating, poor nutrition, and weight gain. About one-third of the calories in an average American's diet come from restaurant or other away-from-home foods. Children eat almost twice as many calories (770) when they eat a meal at a restaurant as they do when they eat at home (420). 
	12.	The Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, among other public health agencies, have developed guidelines and recommendations on healthy nutritional standards for children's meals. The food and beverages that restaurants typically serve to children and adolescents often fail to meet these accepted nutritional recommendations. Ninety-eight percent of California school children have diets that do not meet the current dietary recommendations. 
	13.	Restaurant foods are generally higher in those nutrients for which over-consumption is a problem, such as fat and saturated fat, and lower in nutrients required for good health, such as calcium and fiber. An analysis of nutrient quality of children's meals served by restaurant chains found that only 3 percent met USDA criteria for meals served under the National School Lunch Program. Children who ate restaurant food compared with those who did not consumed more total fat, more total carbohydrates, more sugar-sweetened beverages, less fiber, less milk, and fewer fruits and non-starchy vegetables. 
	14.	Dietitians with the non-profit Physicians Committee For Responsible Medicine (PCRM) analyzed the menu offerings at five major restaurants and found that most children's meals are alarmingly high in fat, cholesterol and calories. Some contain more sodium and as much saturated fat as a child should consume in an entire day. 
	15.	America's rising obesity rates reflect increased intake of oils, cheese, meat and frozen deserts, as reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Children's menus at the largest chain restaurants are dominated by burgers, chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese, French fries, and soft drinks. The most common entree on children's menus is fried chicken in some form, available at 89 percent of the largest chain restaurants. 
	16.	Portion sizes are often large at restaurants and people tend to eat greater quantities of food when they are served more, whether or not they are hungry. 
	17.	Restaurants encourage children and adolescents to choose specific menu items by linking them with free toys and other incentive items. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimated that the ten restaurant chains surveyed spent $360 million in 2006 to acquire toys distributed with children's meals. The FTC reported that in 2006, fast food restaurants sold more than 1.2 billion meals with toys to children under 12, accounting for 20 percent of all child traffic. 
	18.	The Center for Science in the Public Interest analyzed-children's meals at major restaurant chains in 2008 and found that many exceed the recommended caloric limits for children. And almost every high-calorie meal in the study came with toys. 
	19.	Toys, games, trading cards, admission tickets, and other items given out by restaurants tend to be particularly appealing to children and adolescents. Digital incentives like computer games and on-line media similarly appeal to youth. 
	20.	Research shows that parents frequently make purchases based on requests made by children, particularly for items that are geared toward children. Additionally, children and adolescents ages 4-17 years have increasing discretionary income that is frequently spent on restaurant food. 
	21.	The FTC recommends that companies adopt nutrition-based standards for food and beverages targeted at children. However, as of March 2010, 35 of 45 major national restaurant chains surveyed had no policies or extremely vague policies on this issue, and the remaining 10 restaurant chains were found to have key weaknesses in their policies or the nutritional criteria used. 
	22.	By enacting this ordinance, the City seeks to regulate the sales practice of restaurants physically packaging or tying a free toy (or other incentive item) with unhealthy food for children. The City does not seek to limit or regulate any speech, communication or advertising on the part of any restaurant in any manner. Nor does the City seek to ban entirely the practice of tying free toys with children's meals. Rather, the ordinance allows restaurants to engage in this conduct so long as the toy or incentive item is tied with a meal or single food item that meets specified nutritional standards. By limiting this sales practice to healthy food, the ordinance seeks to encourage and increase the likelihood that parents will make healthier choices for their children when eating out in restaurants, and to encourage and increase the likelihood that children will make healthier choices for themselves at restaurants.

SEC. 471.2.  TITLE AND PURPOSE.
	This Ordinance shall be known as the "Healthy Food Incentives Ordinance." The intent of this Ordinance is to improve the health of children and adolescents in San Francisco by setting healthy nutritional standards for children's meals sold at restaurants in combination with free toys or other incentive items. These standards will support families seeking healthy eating choices for their children by permitting restaurants to give away free toys and other incentive items in combination with foods only if those foods meet specified nutritional criteria. This Ordinance imposes no requirements or regulations for the advertising or labeling of food or beverages or the disclosure of ingredients.

The time period shall be determined based on the nature and severity of the nuisance and any other circumstances of which the Director is aware. The order shall state either that, failure to abate and remove the nuisance will result in the abatement of the nuisance by the Department and that the Owner shall become indebted to the City and County of San Francisco for the costs, charges, and fees incurred by reason of the abatement and removal of such nuisance upon demand, or that failure to make the relocation benefit payments will result in the offering of relocation services to the affected tenant(s) by the Department and that the Owner shall become indebted to the City and County of San Francisco for the costs, charges, and fees incurred by reason of the making such relocation services available upon demand. The order shall inform the Responsible Parties that it shall be indebted to the City and County of San Francisco for all administrative costs, including attorneys' fees if sought by the Director in the Notice of Hearing, incurred by the Department in the prosecution of the abatement action or the prosecution of the relocation benefit payment action and that such costs are due upon demand.

		(6)	In case of an unsanitary building, the Director shall revoke the certification of sanitation if the building is a hotel and may order the vacation of any unsanitary building for all purposes, and shall cause a copy of said order to be posted in conspicuous places throughout the aforesaid structure, building or part thereof determined by the Director to be a nuisance, and a copy thereof is to be personally served upon the Owner thereof or his agent, or the lessee or the occupant thereof.

The term "administrative costs" shall include attorneys' fees for those cases in which such fees have been awarded to the Department under this Article. The City and County of San Francisco shall thereupon have a lien for such costs, upon such real property until payment thereof, which lien shall also include additional charges for administrative expenses of $1,000, or 10 percent of the costs of abatement and removal, whichever is higher, and interest at a rate of 1½ percent per month, or fraction thereof, compounded monthly from the date of recordation of the lien on all fees and charges due as aforesaid.

The Director shall cause a notice itemizing the cost of abatement and removal to be mailed in the manner herein provided for mailing Notice of Hearing, which notice shall demand payment thereof to the Department, and shall give notice of claim of such lien and of the recording of the same, in the event such amount is not paid, as hereinafter set forth. 
	(b)	Recording of Lien. If the costs as provided for in subsection (a) of this Section are not paid to the Department within 45 days after mailing of notice thereof, the Director shall file in the Office of the Recorder of the City and County a verified claim containing a particular description of the property subject to such lien, the place and general nature of the administrative costs and of the abatement and removal for which the lien is claimed, the date of posting of said property, the date of the service of Notice of Violation and the Director's order, and the date of the removal of the nuisance, the name of the Owner of the property as aforesaid and the amount of the lien claimed, which shall include the cost of verification and filing thereof. 
	(c)	Collection by Bureau of Delinquent Revenue. The Director shall also transmit to the Bureau of Delinquent Revenue, on the expiration of such 45-day period, a statement of each such unpaid costs, together with the cost of verification and filing and claim therefor. The bureau shall endeavor diligently to collect the same on behalf of the City and County by foreclosure of the lien therefor or otherwise. Any and all amounts paid or collected shall replenish the revolving fund hereinafter provided. 
	(d)	Release of Lien. On payment of any such claim of lien, the Director shall give a release thereof. 
	(e)	Continuing Appropriation Account. There is hereby created a Special Revenue Fund for a continuing appropriation account entitled "Payment of Property Owner's Delinquencies for Abatement and Removal of Nuisances." 
	The account shall be credited with such sums as may be appropriate by the Board of Supervisors, amounts collected by the Department and sums received in consideration of release of liens and payment of special assessments. Expenditures from said sums shall be made to pay for the abatement and removal of nuisances as provided in this Article. In the event that the unexpended balance in said account shall exceed $200,000 such excess shall be transferred to the unappropriated balance of the general fund. 
	(f)	Collection of Expenses as a Special Assessment. The Director may initiate proceedings to make unpaid expenses for the administration of the abatement action and for the abatement and removal of nuisances a special assessment against the parcels of property from which the nuisance was abated and removed by the Department. 
	(g)	Report of Delinquencies Transmitted to Board of Supervisors. A report of delinquent charges shall be transmitted to the Board of Supervisors by the Director as necessary, but in no event less often than once each year, commencing with the first anniversary of the date of enactment of this ordinance. Upon receipt by the Board of Supervisors of the report, it shall fix a time, date and place for hearing the report and any protests or objections thereto. 
	(h)	Notice of Hearing. The Board of Supervisors shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to the Owner of the real property and any person or entity with a recorded interest in the property to which the service was rendered not less than 10 days prior to the date of hearing. 
	(i)	Hearing. At the time for consideration of the report, the Board of Supervisors shall hear it with any objections of the Owners liable to be assessed for all administrative costs incurred and the costs of abatement and removal by the Director, if any. The Board of Supervisors may make such revisions, corrections or modifications of the report as it may deem just and, in the event that the Board of Supervisors is satisfied with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified), it shall be confirmed or rejected by resolution. The decision of the Board of Supervisors on the report and on all protests or objections thereto shall be final and conclusive. 
	(j)	Collection of Assessment. Upon confirmation of the report by the Board of Supervisors, the delinquent charges contained therein shall constitute a special assessment against the property to which the services were rendered. At the time the special assessment is imposed, the Director shall give notice to the Owner and other parties with an interest in the property by certified mail, and shall inform them that the property may be sold by the Tax Collector for unpaid delinquent assessments after three-years. Thereafter, said assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and same procedure of sale as provided for delinquent, ordinary municipal taxes. 
	The assessments shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the property and paramount to all other liens except those for Stats, county and municipal taxes with which it shall be on parity. Such assessment lien shall continue until the assessment and all interest and penalties due and payable thereon are paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to said special assessments. However, if any real property to which the costs of abatement and removal relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the costs of abatement and removal shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
	(k)	Severability. If any part or provision of this Article or application thereof, to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the ordinance, including the application of such part or provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall continue in full force and effect. To this end the provisions of this ordinance are severable.

DIVISION I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SEC. 800.  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares the following: 
	(a)	There are seven (7) distinct groundwater basins in the City and County of San Francisco. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission identified the existing and potential uses of some of these aquifers, including but not limited to supply of water for domestic purposes in San Francisco; use of groundwater for irrigation of City parks; landscaping and maintaining natural water features; use of groundwater for emergency purposes; conjunctive surface and groundwater to improve reliability of San Francisco's water system; and industrial use of non-potable groundwater to offset demands for potable water. 
	(b)	Perforations of aquifers beneath the City, such as wells and soil borings, may serve as conduits for chemicals to contaminate the groundwater if the wells and soil borings are not constructed properly. 
	(c)	Because San Francisco is situated at the end of a peninsula surrounded on three sides by salt water, and due to the potential for earthquakes and other natural disasters to interrupt the supply of imported water to San Francisco from Hetch Hetchy and other sources, available groundwater supplies in San Francisco constitute an important resource held in trust for the benefit of the People of San Francisco. 
	(d)	The People of San Francisco have a primary interest in the location, construction, maintenance, abandonment and destruction of wells, such as monitoring wells and cathodic protection wells, and soil borings which activities directly affect the quality and purity of groundwater. 
	(e)	The purpose of this Article is to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the People of the City and County of San Francisco by ensuring that local groundwater resources designated for beneficial uses will not be polluted or contaminated. To these ends, this Article sets forth minimum requirements for (1) construction, modification and destruction of wells and other perforations of the water table, and (2) operation of such wells. 
	(f)	Unmanaged use of groundwater in San Francisco creates a risk of harm to a common resource shared by all San Franciscans as part of the City's historic Pueblo water right to all water, surface and underground, within the historic Pueblo of San Francisco. Potential risks include, but are not limited to, land subsidence; contamination of aquifer(s) through improper well construction and closure; seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers as a result of pumping in excess of the aquifer's safe yield; and adverse environmental impacts on San Francisco's few remaining natural streams and lakes. 
	(g)	It shall be the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to make beneficial use of groundwater where economically and environmentally feasible, and to prevent the use of groundwater when necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the People of the City and County.

(Added by Proposition P, 11/8/83)
SEC. 1005.  PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.

SEC. 1006.  PURPOSE.
	The Board of Supervisors has a longstanding interest in the risks to human health of tobacco use, and disease prevention and health promotion are essential components of this health policy. Cigarette smoking is a certifiable health danger to smokers and nonsmokers alike. By smoking cigarettes, or being exposed to secondhand smoke, people inhale various chemicals including, for example, formaldehyde, ammonia, tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide. The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema, and that smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury, premature birth, and low birth weight. The Board of Supervisors desires to prevent disease and promote the health of the people of San Francisco by making it easier for residents and visitors to avoid secondhand smoke in eating establishments. For the most part, this Article simply extends the smoking prohibitions of Article 19 to include eating establishments.

SEC. 1007.  FINDINGS.
	The question of whether tobacco smoke is harmful to smokers was answered more than 20 years ago. U.S. Public Health Service reports on the health consequences of smoking have conclusively established cigarette smoking as the largest single preventable cause of premature death and disability in the United States. As a result many scientists began to question whether the low levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) received by nonsmokers could be harmful. 
	The 1986 Surgeon General's Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking clearly documents that nonsmokers are placed at increased risk for developing disease as the result of ETS exposure. The term "involuntary smoking" denotes that for many nonsmokers, exposure to ETS is the result of an unavoidable consequence of being in close proximity to smokers. 
	The report contains the following conclusions: (1) Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers. (2) Simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke. 
	The quality of the indoor environment must be a concern of all who control and occupy that environment. Protection of individuals from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is therefore a responsibility shared by all. As employers and employees we must ensure that the act of smoking does not expose the nonsmoker to tobacco smoke. For smokers, it is their responsibility to assure that their behavior does not jeopardize the health of others. For nonsmokers, it is their responsibility to provide a supportive environment for smokers who are attempting to stop. 
	The scientific case against involuntary smoking as a health risk is more than sufficient to justify this legislative measure, the goal of which must be to protect the nonsmoker from environmental tobacco smoke.

	(a)	The United States Surgeon General's 1986 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking reports the following:
		(1)	Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers.
		(2)	The children of parents who smoke compared with the children of nonsmoking parents have an increased frequency of respiratory infections, increased respiratory symptoms, and slightly smaller rates of increase in lung function as the lung matures. 
		(3)	The simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke. 
	(b)	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares:
		(1)	Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them when they involuntarily inhale tobacco smoke. 
		(2)	Regulation of smoking in public places is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of nonsmokers.
	(c)	It is, therefore, the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this Article, to protect the nonsmoker from environmental tobacco smoke and to eliminate smoking, as much as possible, in public places.

PROHIBITING SMOKING IN ENCLOSED AREAS, CERTAIN UNENCLOSED AREAS, AND SPORTS STADIUMS
Sec. 1009.20.Findings.Sec. 1009.21.Definitions.Sec. 1009.22.Prohibiting Smoking in Buildings, Certain Vehicles, Certain Unenclosed Areas, and Enclosed Structures Containing Certain Uses and Certain Areas of Sports Stadiums.Sec. 1009.23.Exceptions.Sec. 1009.25.Violations and Penalties.Sec. 1009.26.Cost Recovery.Sec. 1009.27.Liens.Sec. 1009.29.Authority to Adopt Rules and Regulations.Sec. 1009.30.City Undertaking Limited to Promotion of the General Welfare.Sec. 1009.31.Preemption.Sec. 1009.33.Severability.Sec. 1009.35.Disclaimers.Sec. 1009.37.Relationship to Other Smoking Restrictions.
SEC. 1009.20.  FINDINGS.
	(a)	The United States Surgeon General's 2006 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking reports the following:
		(1)	Smoking is the single greatest preventable cause of disease and death.
		(2)	Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of chemicals known to be toxic or carcinogenic (cancer causing), including formaldehyde, benzene, vinyl chloride, arsenic, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide. 
		(3)	Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma. Smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children. 
		(4)	Concentrations of many cancer-causing and toxic chemicals are higher in secondhand smoke than in the smoke inhaled by smokers.
		(5)	Breathing secondhand smoke for even a short time can have immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and interferes with the normal functioning of the heart, blood, and vascular systems in ways that increase the risk of a heart attack. 
		(6)	The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.
		(7)	Short exposures to secondhand smoke can cause blood platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack. 
		(8)	Secondhand smoke contains many chemicals that can quickly irritate and damage the lining of the airways. Even brief exposure can result in upper airway changes in healthy persons and can lead to increased and more frequent asthma attacks in children who already have asthma. 
		(9)	Secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers.
		(10)	The children of parents who smoke compared with the children of nonsmoking parents have an increased frequency of respiratory infections, increased respiratory symptoms, and slightly smaller rates of increase in lung function as the lung matures. 
		(11)	Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. 
	(b)	The California Air Resources Board issued a report in January 2006 that identified secondhand smoke as a toxic air contaminant with no safe level of exposure. Secondhand smoke has joined benzene, arsenic, and diesel exhaust on the Toxic Air Contaminant list. According to the report: 
		(1)	Each year in California, secondhand smoke is linked to: (A) 400 additional lung cancer deaths a year in nonsmokers; (B) 3,600 deadly heart attacks; and, (C) 31,000 asthma attacks in children. 
		(2)	Health effects causally associated with exposure to secondhand smoke include (A) breast cancer in younger, primarily premenopausal women; (B) asthma induction and exacerbation in children and adults; (C) pre-term delivery; and (D) altered vascular properties associated with risk for heart attack. 
		(3)	Concentrations of secondhand smoke in some outdoor locations can reach levels as high as indoor locations, depending on the number of cigarettes being smoked and wind conditions. 
		(4)	According to the 2002-2004 California Student Tobacco Survey, 49 percent of youths reported being exposed to secondhand smoke from someone smoking in the same room during the previous seven days. According to the 2002 California Tobacco Survey, 11.9 percent of non-smoking Californian indoor workers reported having been exposed to secondhand smoke at work within the past two weeks, with 64.7 percent exposed on a daily basis. 
		(5)	In 2005, 13.9 percent of San Francisco adults were smokers, including 7.5 percent who were daily smokers and 6.4 percent who were occasional smokers. "Occasional smokers" are smokers who do not smoke on a daily basis. 
	(c)	The 2003 Final Report on Tobacco Control Successes prepared by the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at the University of California, San Diego, for the California Department of Health Services found: 
		(1)	15.6 percent of Latinos, 11.3 percent of Asians, 9.5 percent of African Americans, and 10.4 percent of Whites were exposed to secondhand smoke in indoor workplaces within two weeks of answering the survey. 
		(2)	In the home setting, African American children and adolescents were found to have the highest rate of exposure (14.3 percent) to secondhand smoke compared to 5.7 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders, 8.5 percent of Latinos and 10.9 percent of Whites. 
		(3)	Residents living in multi-unit housing complexes can be exposed to secondhand smoke that seeps from neighboring units through doorways, electrical sockets, cracks in the sealing, shared ventilation systems, holes in wall plates and subfloor assemblies for electrical wiring, plumbing, and ductwork. 
	(d)	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares:
		(1)	Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them by secondhand smoke.
		(2)	Regulation of smoking in public places is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of nonsmokers.
	(e)	It is, therefore, the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this Article, to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke and to eliminate smoking, as much as possible, in public places, and certain residential settings.

	(g)	Smoking is prohibited in all vehicles owned by the City and County of San Francisco.
	(h)	It is unlawful for any person to smoke in any area where this Article prohibits smoking. It is unlawful for the owner of any property, facility or establishment subject to this Article or if a different person has the right to possession or management of such property, facility or establishment, for that person to permit any person to smoke in any area where smoking is prohibited by this Article, and the owner or manager had or should have had actual or constructive knowledge acquired by due diligence of the smoking. This subsection does not require a property owner or manager of a business to enforce a smoking prohibition outside the business against persons who are not patrons of the business, or a property owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex to enforce a smoking prohibition outside the building against persons who are not tenants of the building. 
	(i)	Any person who owns, operates or manages property is required to take the following steps to prevent smoking on that property where it is prohibited under this Code: 
		(1)	Post clear and prominent signs at each entrance to the premises no higher than 8 feet and no lower than 5 feet, and within 10 feet of the door or the most appropriate place for visibility from outside, that read "Smoking only 1) at the curb, or 2) if no curb, at least 15 ft. from entrances, exits, operable windows, and vents" in letters no less than one half inch in height and include 1) the international "No Smoking" symbol, consisting of a pictorial representation of a burning cigarette enclosed in a circle, with a diameter of at least three inches, with a bar across it, and 2) a statement at the bottom of the sign that reads "SF Health Code Article 19F" in font no less than  inch in height. Persons that own, manage, or operate property that is LEED ("Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design") certified that has a smoking distance requirement greater than that specified in this ordinance shall post signs conforming to all the requirements in this Section that state that smoking only is allowed at that greater distance from the exists, entrances, and operable windows. 
		(2)	Post clear and prominent "no smoking" signs in any area on the premises where smoking is prohibited. For multi-unit housing complexes, the signs need only be posted in the common building lobby, common mailbox area, or common elevator. 
		(3)	Request that any person smoking in areas where smoking is prohibited under this Article refrain from smoking. But this subsection does not require a property owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex of less than 16 units to make the request that a person refrain from smoking unless the owner or manager observes the person smoking in areas where smoking is prohibited under this Article, nor does this subsection require a property owner or manager of a business to enforce the smoking prohibition in Section 1009.22(d) outside a business by persons who are not patrons of the business, or a property owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex to enforce a smoking prohibition outside the building by persons who are not tenants of the building. 
			Upon receipt of a written complaint from a tenant or the Department of Public Health or when any person is observed smoking where smoking is prohibited, an owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex must post a notice in the building lobby, common mailbox area, or common elevator for a period of not less than ten days, advising that a tenant has been observed smoking is a portion of the building where smoking is prohibited under San Francisco Health Code Article 19F, and requesting that all tenants refrain from smoking in those areas. If there is no common building lobby, common mailbox area or common elevator, then the owner may provide notice to tenants in another reasonable manner. If the owner knows the identity of the tenant who was smoking in a prohibited area, the owner must additionally make the request to the tenant in writing, and keep a record of the request for a reasonable period of time. For purposes of this subsection, a request that someone refrain from smoking does not require the physical ejectment of a person from the premises.

SEC. 1009.23.  EXCEPTIONS.
	The following places shall not be subject to this Article: 
	(a)	Tourist lodging facility room accommodations designated as smoking rooms, provided that the owners or managers of tourist lodging facilities shall designate at least 75 percent of the guest rooms in tourist lodging facilities as smoke free. The owners or managers of tourist lodging facilities must permanently designate particular guest rooms as smoke free and ashtrays and matches are to be permanently removed from such smoke free rooms. "No smoking" signage shall be displayed in smoke free rooms. Where possible, designated smoke free rooms shall not be located on the same floor as smoking rooms. It is recommended that smoking be relegated to the top floor with at least 50 percent of the rooms on the top floor designated as smoke free. Owners and managers of tourist lodging facilities may designate 100% of guest rooms as smoke free; if such 100% smoke free designation is made, "no smoking" signage shall only be required in the common areas on each floor of such tourist lodging facilities. 
	(b)	Private homes, including but not limited to dwelling units, but not the common areas, of multi-unit housing complexes and mixed-use buildings. 
	(c)	Bars and Taverns located in commercial buildings that submit to the Director within three months of the effective date of this ordinance an application and all documents required by the Director to demonstrate that the bar or tavern had no employees as of December 31, 2009. If the Director approves the application under the criteria of this subsection, the bar or tavern may allow smoking on the premises but must immediately 1) notify the Director if the establishment hires any employees, and 2) submit all documents to the Director verifying eligibility for this exemption upon request. The exemption will continue for as long as the establishment has no employees and the building where the bar or tavern is located continues to be commercial. Bars and Taverns located in mixed-use buildings that 1) have no employees as of December 31, 2009, and 2) relocate to a commercial building within two years of the effective date of this ordinance may allow smoking in their establishment after relocation to a commercial building if they submit to the Director within three months of the effective date of this ordinance an application and all documents required by the Director to demonstrate that the bar or tavern had no employees as of December 31, 2009. The application must also document that the Bar or Tavern will be located in a commercial building within two years of the effective date of this ordinance. This exemption status immediately expires if the establishment hires employees, or is no longer located in a commercial building. 
	(d)	Bars and Taverns located in commercial buildings that submit to the Director within three months of the effective date of this ordinance an application and all documents required by the Director to demonstrate that an area in the establishment is a historically compliant semi-enclosed smoking room and qualified as such as of December 31, 2009. If the Director denies the application because the Bar or Tavern does not comply with the above requirements, the Director may allow the establishments to make alterations to comply with this requirement; if the Bar or Tavern completes the alterations to the Director's satisfaction, the Director may approve the application. If the Director approves the application under the criteria of this subsection, the Bar or Tavern may allow smoking in the historically compliant semi-enclosed smoking room. This exemption status is nontransferable and immediately expires if 1) there is a change in the ownership interest(s) of the Bar or Tavern, 2) the room no longer meets the definition of historically compliant semi-enclosed smoking room, 3) there are structural alterations made to the smoking room after December 31, 2009 not approved by the Director, or 4) the establishment is no longer located in a commercial building. If the Director approves the application under the criteria of this subsection, the Bar or Tavern may allow smoking in the historically compliant semi-enclosed smoking room but must immediately notify the Director of any changes that would disqualify the establishment from this exemption. For purposes of this subsection, the term "change in ownership interest(s)" means the aggregate change of 50 percent or more of the ownership of the business within a 12-month period. 
	(e)	Tobacco Shops that are located in commercial buildings as of December 31, 2009. To qualify for the exemption under this Section, the tobacco shop owner must submit an application and all documents required by the Director. If the Director approves the application, the tobacco shop may allow smoking on the premises. The exemption will continue for as long as the establishment continues to qualify as a tobacco shop and the building where the tobacco shop is located continues to be commercial. The tobacco shop must immediately notify the Director of any change that would disqualify the retailer from this exemption and submit all documents to the Director verifying eligibility upon request.

	(a)	Civil Enforcement. The Director of Public Health may enforce the provisions of this Article against violators by serving notice requiring the correction of any violation within a reasonable time specified by the Director.

Damages may be awarded up to $500 a day for each day the violation occurs or is permitted to continue. It is necessary to specify the amount of such damages because of the extreme difficulty that the owner or other authorized person would have in establishing injury based on lost business, lost productivity due to health injuries caused by tobacco smoke, and other costs arising because of the health problems created by smoking. Any civil penalties collected under this Article shall be credited to the Public Health Environmental Health Code Compliance Fund, authorized by San Francisco Administrative Code Section 10.100-193. 
	(b)	Administrative Enforcement. The Director also may enforce the provisions of this Article by:

The Director shall oversee the hearing and issue a ruling within 20 days of its conclusion. The Director's ruling shall be final; or, 
		(2)	Issuing a citation under San Francisco Administrative Code Chapter 100, "Procedures Governing the Imposition of Administrative Fines," which is hereby incorporated in its entirety and shall govern the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of administrative citations issued to enforce this Article, and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this Article, in addition to the other enforcement mechanisms authorized by this Article, provided, however, that: 
			(i)	Each day a violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate violation;
			(ii)	The Director of Public Health shall appoint the hearing officer to conduct hearings for appeals;
			(iii)	The fine for any violation issued pursuant to this section shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco and credited to the Public Health Environmental Health Code Compliance Fund, authorized by San Francisco Administrative Code Section 10.100-193; 
			(iv)	The Director may recover any costs and fees, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, for enforcement initiated through this Section and authorized under this Article; and, 
			(v)	The penalty amounts for citations issued under Administrative Code Chapter 100 shall be the same as those set forth in subsection (c). 
	(c)	Any person who violates or refuses to comply with the provisions of this Article shall be liable for a civil or administrative penalty in the amounts set forth in Cal. Labor Code Sec. 6404.5 for each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue. A civil penalty shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the City and County of San Francisco, by the City Attorney, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any penalty assessed and recovered in a civil or administrative action brought pursuant to this Section shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco and credited to the Public Health Environmental Health Code Compliance Fund. An administrative penalty shall be assessed following an administrative hearing as described in subsection (b).

	(a)	All final costs, fees, and administrative or civil penalties assessed against a person for violations of this Article shall be an obligation owed to the City by the person found to have violated State or local laws pertaining to smoking. Such obligation may be collected by means of the imposition of a lien against the property of the person or business against whom the final administrative or civil penalty was assessed, provided the violation occurred on that property.

Further, in adopting this Article, the Board of Supervisors does not intend to prohibit that which is prohibited by federal or state law. It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors that the provisions of this Article not be enforced in circumstances where duplicative state law already regulates smoking. Rather it is the Board's intention that this Article be enforced as to all business establishments to the fullest extent that state law does not regulate them.

SEC. 1009.50.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco hereby finds and declares as follows: 
	A.	State law prohibits the sale or furnishing of cigarettes, tobacco products and smoking paraphernalia to minors, as well as the purchase, receipt, or possession of tobacco products by minors. (California Penal Code section 308.) State law also prohibits public school students from smoking or using tobacco products while on campus, attending school-sponsored activities, or under the supervision or control of school district employees. (California Education Code section 48901(a).) In addition, state law prohibits smoking in enclosed places of employment (California Labor Code section 6404.5). Moreover, San Francisco has adopted ordinances that ban cigarette vending machines in the City (San Francisco Health Code section 1009.1), prohibit the self-service merchandising of tobacco products, except in places to which access by minors is prohibited by law (San Francisco Police Code section 4600.3), and prohibit smoking in enclosed areas and sports stadiums (San Francisco Health Code section 1009.22). 
	B.	Despite these state and local restrictions, minors continue to obtain cigarettes and other tobacco products at alarming rates. Children under the age of 18 consume 924 million packs of cigarettes annually in the United States. Over 29 million packs of cigarettes are sold to California children annually. More than 60 percent of all smokers begin smoking by the age of 14, and 90 percent begin by age 19. 
	C.	In a 2002 California youth buying survey, 19.3 percent of retailers surveyed unlawfully sold tobacco products to minors compared to 17.1 percent in 2001. 
	D.	California's rate of illegal tobacco sales to minors is steadily increasing. In 2002 the rate was 19.3 percent, up from 17.1 percent in 2001, and 12.8 percent in 2000. 
	E.	The California Department of Health Services reports that 26.7 percent of California adolescents believe it is easy to buy a pack of cigarettes. 
	F.	Despite active enforcement by the San Francisco Police Department, a significant number of retailers continue to sell tobacco illegally to minors. The rate of illegal tobacco sales documented by the Police Department during 2001 was 25.3 percent and 20.2 percent in 2002. 
	G.	In a youth decoy operation conducted by the Police Department, 50 percent of the 12 bars visited illegally sold tobacco to a minor. 
	H.	San Francisco has a substantial interest in promoting compliance with State laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, in promoting compliance with laws intended to discourage the purchase of tobacco products by minors, and in protecting our children from illegally obtained tobacco. 
	I.	Requiring tobacco vendors to obtain a tobacco sales permit will not unduly burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute cigarettes or other tobacco products to adults. It will, however, allow the City to regulate those establishments selling tobacco products to ensure that they comply with federal, state, and local tobacco laws. 
	J.	This Article is designed to promote the public interest in ensuring that San Francisco businesses operate in compliance with applicable laws regulating tobacco, including laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors and laws regulating smoking.

SEC. 1009.52.  REQUIREMENT FOR TOBACCO SALES PERMIT.
	It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in tobacco sales, or to allow tobacco sales, in any establishment without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco sales permit from the Department for each location where tobacco sales are conducted. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco sales permit any status or right other than the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location identified on the face of the permit. The obtaining of a permit does not in and of itself transform a business into a retail tobacco or wholesale shop within the meaning of California Labor Code section 6404.5. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in tobacco sales, or to allow tobacco sales, at an establishment for which the Director has suspended the tobacco sales while the period of suspension remains in effect. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in or allow tobacco sales at an establishment for which the Director has revoked the tobacco sales permit for three years from the date of revocation. Permits are valid as long as the annual license fees are paid.

	(a)	Application. An application for a tobacco sales permit shall be submitted in the name of the person(s) proposing to engage in the sale of tobacco products and shall be signed by each person or an authorized agent thereof.

		1.	The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;
		2.	The establishment name, address, and telephone number for each location for which a tobacco sales permit is sought;
		3.	Such other information as the Director deems appropriate, including the applicant's type of business, and whether the applicant has previously been issued a permit under this Article that is, or was at any time, suspended or revoked. 
	(b)	Inspection by Director. Upon receipt of a completed application and fees, the Director may inspect the location at which tobacco sales are to be permitted. The Director may also ask the applicant to provide additional information that is reasonably related to the determination whether a permit may issue. 
	(c)	Issuance of Permit. If the Director is satisfied that the applicant has met the requirements of this Article and that issuance of the permit will not violate any law, the Department shall issue the permit. No permit shall issue if the Director finds that the applicant is in violation of San Francisco Health Code section 1009.1 (regulating cigarette vending machines), San Francisco Police Code section 4600.3 (regulating the self-service merchandising of tobacco products), or if the applicant is a pharmacy prohibited from selling tobacco products under Article 19J. No permit shall issue if the application is incomplete or inaccurate. 
	(d)	Display of Permit. Each permittee shall display the permit prominently at each location where tobacco sales occur. No permit that has been suspended shall be displayed during the period of suspension. A permit that has been revoked is void and may not be displayed.

SEC. 1009.54.  PERMIT AND ANNUAL LICENSE FEES.
	(a)	The Department shall charge every applicant for a tobacco sales permit a non-refundable application fee for the initial inspection and processing of the application and an annual license fee sufficient to cover the costs of annual inspections, as determined by the Director. The application and processing fee shall be $53 and is otherwise governed by Section 35 of the San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code. The annual fee is listed in Section 249.16 of the San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code. The Fee shall be due annually on March 31 of each year, pursuant to Section 76.1, Article 2 of the San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code.*
	(b)	Beginning with fiscal year 2008-2009, fees set forth in this Section and referred to in this Section may be adjusted each year, without further action by the Board of Supervisors, as set forth in this Section. 
		Not later than April 1, the Director shall report to the Controller the revenues generated by the fees for the prior fiscal year and the prior fiscal year's costs of operation, as well as any other information that the Controller determines appropriate to the performance of the duties set forth in this Section. 
		Not later than May 15, the Controller shall determine whether the current fees have produced or are projected to produce revenues sufficient to support the costs of providing the services for which the fees are assessed and that the fees will not produce revenue which is significantly more than the costs of providing the services for which the fess are assessed. 
		The Controller shall, if necessary, adjust the fees upward or downward for the upcoming fiscal year as appropriate to ensure that the program recovers the costs of operation without producing revenue which is significantly more than such costs.

PROHIBITING SMOKING AT CERTAIN OUTDOOR EVENTS
Sec. 19L.1.Findings.Sec. 19L.2.Definitions.Sec. 19L.3.Prohibiting Smoking at Certain Outdoor Events.Sec. 19L.4.Violations.
SEC. 19L.1.  FINDINGS.
	(a)	The United States Surgeon General's 2006 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking provides the following:
		(1)	Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
		(2)	Secondhand smoke is responsible for as many as 3,000 deaths from lung cancer and 46,000 deaths from heart disease among nonsmokers each year in the United States.
		(3)	Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma.
		(4)	Scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.
	(b)	According to several studies conducted measuring the tobacco smoke concentrations in various outdoor settings:
		(1)	Levels of secondhand smoke exposure outdoors can reach levels attained indoors depending on direction and amount of wind, as well as the number and proximity of smokers.
		(2)	Irritation from secondhand smoke begins at levels as low as 4 micrograms per cubic meter. In some situations this level can be found as far away as 13 feet from the burning cigarette.
		(3)	To be completely free from exposure to secondhand smoke in outdoor places, a person may have to move nearly 25 feet away from the source of the smoke, about the width of a two lane road.
		(4)	Studies on a cruise ship found that even while cruising at 20 knots and with unlimited air volume, outdoor smoking areas contained carcinogens in nearly the same amounts as inside the ship's casino where smoking was allowed.
	(c)	According to the 2009 California Health Interview Survey, creating smoke free areas helps protect the health of the 88.4% of San Franciscans who are nonsmokers.
	(d)	According to the 2008 Study of California Voters' Attitudes About Secondhand Smoke Exposure found that 75% thought that secondhand smoke is harmful, 64% were bothered by secondhand smoke, 73% support laws restricting smoking at outdoor public places, and people living in cities with strong smoke free air laws are more likely to believe smoking is not acceptable and that smokers should attempt to quit smoking.
	(e)	A 2011 Opinion Survey conducted at seven street events in San Francisco from August to October, found that out of the almost 600 surveys collected: 67% favored making all street events in San Francisco smoke-free and 58.9% have been bothered by secondhand smoke at street events.
	(f)	According to the California Clean Air Project, California Secondhand Smoke Policy Database, as of 2008, there were 187 California cities and counties with local laws restricting smoking in at least one outdoor area.
	(g)	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares:
		(1)	Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them by secondhand smoke.
		(2)	Regulation of smoking at outdoor events is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of nonsmokers.
		(3)	It is, therefore, the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this Article, to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke and to eliminate smoking, as much as possible, at certain outdoor events.

ARTICLE 20:
ALKYL NITRITES
Sec. 1010.Purpose and Findings.Sec. 1011.Definitions.Sec. 1012.Sale and Display of Alkyl Nitrite Products to Minors Prohibited.Sec. 1013.Warning Required at Point of Sale.Sec. 1013.1.Exemption.Sec. 1014.Use Prohibited in Public Places.Sec. 1015.Misdemeanor Penalty.Sec. 1016.Severability.
SEC. 1010.  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds: 
	(a)	Alkyl nitrite products are held out for retail sale as "room odorizers" or room incenses, but purchasers commonly use them as inhalants to induce certain physical responses. 
	(b)	The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, enforced by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulates the manufacture and sale of, inter alia, drugs and devices intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body. The FDA does not regulate room odorizers since they purportedly function as a general air incense and are not intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body. The Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law of California is based on the federal act and also does not regulate room odorizers containing alkyl nitrites. Therefore, these room odorizers are not currently subject to regulation by federal, state or local drug control agencies. 
	(c)	The manufacturers and distributors are advertising alkyl nitrite products as safe, thus causing users of such products to believe that they can be inhaled without any harmful effects. These representations are contrary to the opinion of the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission which has issued regulations requiring that consumer products containing alkyl nitrites be labeled to caution against inhaling, since the substance may be harmful to a person's health, and to statements by the FDA and the Center for Disease Control warning about possible adverse effects from ingesting or inhaling alkyl nitrites. 
	(d)	The proliferation of the display of alkyl nitrite products in retail stores within the City and County of San Francisco, and the distribution of such products without proper warnings, exacerbates problems attending the abuse of alkyl nitrite products within this community. 
	(e)	The problems caused by inhaling alkyl nitrites are as yet not completely understood, but there are indications that they may be carcinogenic and also may impair the immune system. Hence steps must be taken to stop the encouragement of the abuse of alkyl nitrite products as inhalants fostered by their unregulated display and sale. 
	(f)	The Bureau of Communicable Disease Control of the Department of Public Health has prepared a report on the medical aspects of volatile alkyl nitrites and their relationship with AIDS. This report concludes that volatile alkyl nitrites are hazardous substances on toxicologic grounds alone and that there is epidemiologic evidence which associates moderate and heavy alkyl nitrite use with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma which is one of the principal manifestations of AIDS. 
	(g)	This ordinance is necessary in order to discourage the abuse of products containing alkyl nitrites within the City and County of San Francisco. 
(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1011.  DEFINITIONS.
	(a)	"Alkyl nitrite" means any volatile alkyl nitrite compound, including, but not limited to, amyl nitrite, butyl nitrite and iso-butyl nitrite. 
	(b)	"Alkyl nitrite product" means all products of any kind, sold at retail, containing an alkyl nitrite, whether or not such product is intended for use or designed for use in injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing alkyl nitrite into the human body. "Alkyl nitrite products" include, but are not limited to, products containing alkyl nitrites and intended for use or designed for use as a room odorizer or incense. 
	(c)	"Business" means a fixed location, whether indoors or outdoors, at which merchandise is offered for sale at retail.
	(d)	"Display" means to show to a patron or place in a manner so as to be available for viewing or inspection by a patron.
	(e)	"Patron" means a person who enters a business for the purpose of purchasing or viewing as a shopper merchandise offered for sale at the business. 
	(f)	"Person" means a natural person or any firm, partnership, association, corporation or cooperative association.
(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1012.  SALE AND DISPLAY OF ALKYL NITRITE PRODUCTS TO MINORS PROHIBITED.
	(a)	No owner, manager, proprietor in charge of any room in any place of business selling, or displaying for the purpose of sale, any device or product containing alkyl nitrites other than prescription drugs and devices to inhale, ingest or inject prescription drugs, may allow or permit any person under the age of 18 years to be, remain in, enter or visit such room unless such minor person is accompanied by one of his or her parents, or by his or her legal guardian. 
	(b)	A person under the age of 18 years may not be in, remain in, enter or visit any room in any place used for the sale, or displaying for sale, of devices or products containing alkyl nitrites, other than prescription drugs, unless such person is accompanied by one of his or her parents, or by his or her legal guardian. 
	(c)	A person may not maintain a display for the sale of, or the offering to sell, devices or products containing alkyl nitrites, other than prescription drugs and devices to inhale, ingest or inject prescription drugs, in any place or business to which the public is invited unless such display is within a separate room or enclosure to which minors not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian are excluded. Each entrance to such a room shall have a sign posted in reasonably visible and legible words to the effect that alkyl nitrite products are being offered for sale in such a room, and minors, unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, are excluded. 
(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1013.  WARNING REQUIRED AT POINT OF SALE.
	All owners, managers, proprietors in charge of any room in any place or business selling, or displaying for the purpose of sale, any device or product containing alkyl nitrites other than prescription drugs and devices to inhale, ingest or inject prescription drugs, shall post a warning sign at eye level, between five and six feet from the floor, and adjacent to any alkyl nitrite product offered for sale. Such sign shall be not less than eight inches by eleven inches in size and shall be printed on a contrasting background and in a legible manner conveying the following warning: 
	"WARNING: These products contain alkyl nitrites ("Poppers"). Inhaling or swallowing alkyl nitrite may be harmful to your health. The use of alkyl nitrites may affect the immune system. Several studies have suggested that their use is associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (an AIDS condition)." 
	The word "WARNING" shall be in a print of 84 point height and Helvetica type and the remainder of the text in a print of 24 point height and in Helvetica medium-face, Futura medium-face or Universe 65 type. 
(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1013.1.  EXEMPTION.
	Sections 1012 and 1013 shall not apply to any of the following:

(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1014.  USE PROHIBITED IN PUBLIC PLACES.
	No person shall use, or cause to be used, an alkyl nitrite product in a place of public accommodation or amusement or on public property. Any alkyl nitrite product in a place of public accommodation or amusement or on public property that is uncapped or otherwise emitting alkyl nitrite vapors into the air shall be deemed to be in use. 
(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1015.  MISDEMEANOR PENALTY.

Any person convicted of a misdemeanor hereunder is punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment for a period of not more than six months, or by both. A person who violates the provisions of Section 1012 is guilty of a separate offense for each day, or portion thereof, during which the violation continues. A person who violates the provisions of Section 1013 is guilty of a separate offense for each item of alkyl nitrite products which is distributed. 
(Amended by Ord. 200-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 1016.  SEVERABILITY.

SEC. 1131.  EMERGENCY POWERS.
	(a)	Whenever the Director of Health or a duly authorized representative discovers a hazardous materials release site, the Director is empowered to order the responsible party or parties to vacate or close the hazardous materials release site and institute emergency remedial actions, as provided in this Section, without a written notice or hearing, until the condition requiring such action has been abated. 
	(b)	Following any unauthorized release, the Director of Health is empowered to order the hazardous materials release site secured from public and/or private access, including the ordering of the evacuation, closure or other isolation of the hazardous materials release site so as to prevent any further public or private exposures to hazardous materials. The Director of Health is also empowered to issue directives as to what monitoring must be done to assess the degree of contamination present and to evaluate what degree of cleanup shall be undertaken in order to assure safe reoccupancy of the hazardous materials release site. 
	(c)	The Director of Health may verify that the unauthorized release of hazardous material is being contained and appropriately disposed. Any time the Director of Health has reason to believe that any responsible party is not adequately containing and disposing of such hazardous material, the Director of Health may undertake and direct an emergency response in order to protect the public health and safety. 
	(d)	In the event the Director of Health determines that immediate action is necessary and the responsible party has not undertaken and will not undertake such necessary action, the Director may direct the institution of those remedial actions reasonably necessary under the circumstances to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community from the hazards attending the unauthorized release.

	(e)	The decision whether any hazardous materials release site is safe for reentry by the public following such order of the Director of Health regarding evacuation, closures, etc. shall be made exclusively by the Director of Health.

Editor's Notes:
	The sections of this Article are numbered out of sequence with the other articles of this Code. Sections designated 1 through 66 are codified in Article 1 above.
	The sections of this Article formerly were numbered 1220 through 1237. As part of its substantial amendments, Ord. 155-13 redesignated the Article' s sections as currently set forth. The history note following each section explains the section's derivation and notes its former section number.
SEC. 22A.1.  FINDINGS.
	1.	Health Code Article 22A and Building Code Section 106A.3.2.4 work in concert to provide an important City process for identifying, investigating, analyzing and, when deemed necessary, remediating or mitigating hazardous substances in soils within specified areas of the City and County of San Francisco ("City").
	2.	These codes provide a specific, well-explained and equitable City process for investigating, analyzing and, when deemed necessary, remediating or mitigating hazardous substances in soils, under the oversight and supervision of the Department of Public Health ("Department"), the City agency with expertise in these matters.
	3.	The Department has overseen the Article 22A process for many years and it is the experience of the Department, given the nature of contamination that has been found on City sites, that these sites can be remediated or mitigated through methods such as removal, treatment, installation of vapor barriers, or covers, or by placing restrictions on uses or activities on the site to protect the environment or public health.
	4.	Health Code Article 22A, Public Works Code Article 20, and Building Code Section 106A.3.2.4 were previously limited in terms of their geographic coverage throughout the City, applying exclusively on the Eastern side of City, more specifically in areas near the Bay shoreline, and areas of known bay fill.
	5.	These Articles were also presently limited in terms of types of potential public health and safety hazards that they address.
	6.	There may be hazardous substances and conditions (e.g., groundwater contamination) that pose a potential threat to the public health and safety but were not previously within the scope of Article 22A.
	7.	Areas outside of the boundaries previously set in Health Code Article 22A, Public Works Code Article 20, and Building Code Section 106A.3.2.4 exist where, based upon historic zoning designation, land use, or site activity, there is a reasonable expectation of the potential for the soil and/or groundwater to contain hazardous substances that may pose public health or safety hazards during construction and with new uses authorized on the site.
	8.	In urban areas, emissions from paved roadways are a major source of atmospheric particulate matter. Paved road dust originates from pavement wear and decomposition, dustfall, litter, mud and dirt carryout, spills, biological debris, and erosion from adjacent areas. In an urban setting, vehicle exhaust and vehicle brake and tire wear are a source of zinc and copper in paved road dust. The authors of a 2006 study found that metal deposits increased in the immediate vicinity of a large freeway, and quickly reduced to urban background deposition rates between 10 meters (30 feet) and 150 meters (450 feet) downwind of the freeway, especially for copper, lead and zinc. Their results suggest: 1) the freeway is a significant source of copper, lead and zinc; and 2) these metals have substantial concentrations of larger particles emitted from the freeway due to the dispersion of road dust by vehicles traveling at high speeds. Lisa D. Sabin, et al., Dry Deposition and Resuspension of Particle-Associated Metals Near a Freeway in Los Angeles, Atmospheric Environment 40 (2006) 7528-7538.
	9.	The benefits of Health Code Article 22A to the City, the environment and the public health and safety can be expanded by broadening the geographic coverage and the types of potential contamination that fall within the scope of the law.
	10.	City departments that engage in regular maintenance and repair of City property and assets, long term capital projects, and emergency work are subject to these same public health and safety requirements with regard to soil and/or groundwater sampling and analysis. These departments will work with the Department of Public Health to develop protocols that use City resources efficiently and facilitate prompt response to emergencies, for any projects that may require soil and/or groundwater testing.

ARTICLE 23:
VIDEO DISPLAY TERMINAL WORKER SAFETY
Sec. 1301.Findings.Sec. 1302.Definitions.Sec. 1304.Workstation Standards.Sec. 1305.Alternative Work.Sec. 1307.Employee Education and Training.Sec. 1308.Employee Rights.Sec. 1309.Variance and Exemption Procedures.Sec. 1310.Fees.Sec. 1311.Right to Entry and Inspection.Sec. 1312.Authority to Adopt Rules and Regulations.Sec. 1313.Enforcement.Sec. 1314.Conflict with Other Laws.Sec. 1315.Severability.
SEC. 1301.  FINDINGS.
	(a)	The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco finds and declares that it shall be the public policy of the City and County of San Francisco to provide public and private sector employees who operate video display terminals within the City and County of San Francisco with a safe and healthy work environment. 
	(b)	Investigations conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of video display terminal (VDT) operators in response to complaints of headaches, general malaise, eyestrain and other visual and musculoskeletal problems resulted in recommendations for VDT workstation design, VDT work breaks and pre-placement and periodic visual testing to reduce musculoskeletal and vision complaints among VDT users. 
	(c)	Various world-wide studies have demonstrated elevated musculoskeletal discomforts and disorders in VDT operators as compared with non-VDT workers. Statistics from these studies show a correlation between VDT use and shoulder-neck discomfort/pain, wrist tendonitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Statistics also show a higher number of vision complaints among VDT operators compared to other workers. Research has shown that inadequate workstation adjustment, lack of operator knowledge of adjustments, and long, uninterrupted use of VDTs are associated with musculoskeletal disorders and vision complaints. The consensus of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the World Health Organization and the American National Standards Institute is that adjustable VDT workstations in combination with training and proper adjustment of the workstation and periodic breaks from VDT use during the work day substantially contribute to suitable working postures and reduce vision complaints, thereby providing a safer and healthier work environment for VDT operators. 
	(d)	This Board of Supervisors further declares that, although some employees and manufacturers have recognized and implemented safeguards in equipment and workstation design and work routine in order to better protect the health and well-being of employees who operate VDTs on a regular basis, many VDT operators remain, as yet, unprotected. The Board of Supervisors finds that by providing for adjustable workstations and education and training covering workstation design and adjustment, work routine, and the causes of and treatments for health effects association with VDT use, employers will furnish a safer and healthier work place for VDT operators.

CHLOROFLUOROCARBON RECOVERY AND RECYCLING
Sec. 1401.Findings and Purpose.Sec. 1402.Definitions.Sec. 1403.Authority to Adopt Rules and Regulations.Sec. 1404.Prohibition on Sale of CFC Containers.Sec. 1405.Prohibition on Release of CFC and Operation Without Permit.Sec. 1406.Permit Requirements.Sec. 1407.Violations.Sec. 1408.Civil Penalties.Sec. 1409.Enforcement.Sec. 1410.Hearings.Sec. 1411.Inspection and Administration Fees.Sec. 1412.Fee Schedule.Sec. 1413.Severability.
SEC. 1401.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
	The Board of Supervisors finds that the release of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) into the environment may endanger public health and welfare by causing or contributing to significant depletion of stratospheric ozone. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that this depletion will result in health and environmental harm, including increased incidence of skin cancer and cataracts, suppression of the immune response system, and damage to crops and aquatic organisms. (Federal Register, August 12, 1988, p. 30566.) The findings adopted under Section 469 of the San Francisco Health Code on stratospheric ozone depletion, health effects and global warming due to releases of CFCs are therefore incorporated herein. 
	The Board of Supervisors finds that repair, replacement and dismantling of mobile air-conditioners in automobiles and trucks are major sources of CFC releases. As part of the repair, replacement and dismantling procedures, CFCs are purged from these systems to the atmosphere. After repair, mobile air conditioners are recharged with newly manufactured CFC supplied in small containers, available at retail stores in San Francisco. When additional repairs are needed, this CFC is purged from the system. Due to this cycle, manufactured CFCs are continually released to the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that approximately 25 percent of domestically consumed CFCs are used in automobiles, making this industry the largest single user of these chemicals. (Federal Register, August 12, 1988, p. 30616.) 
	The Board of Supervisors finds that a prohibition on the release of CFCs by businesses and government agencies that install, repair or dismantle mobile air-conditioners would be a significant benefit to the health and welfare of the people of San Francisco. The Board of Supervisors further finds that measures which lower the supply of CFC for sale in San Francisco, and which break the cycle of recharge and release from mobile air- conditioning systems, will significantly contribute to public health and welfare. 
	The Board of Supervisors finds, therefore, that this legislation requiring permits, inspections and installation of CFC recovery equipment for businesses which release CFCs as part of their work on mobile air- conditioning systems, and prohibiting the sale of small CFC containers, is an essential step for limiting the future release of CFCs to the environment.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
SEC. 1600.  TITLE.
	This law may be cited as the Comprehensive Environmental Lead Poisoning Prevention, Investigation, Management and Enforcement Program. 
(Added by Ord. 376-92, App. 12/23/92; amended by Ord. 409-96, App. 10/21/96; Ord. 36-03, File No. 021857, App. 3/28/2003)
SEC. 1601.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors finds that: 
	(a)	The Centers for Disease Control ("CDC") have determined that childhood lead poisoning is one of the most common pediatric health problems in the United States today, and it is entirely preventable. ("Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children," CDC, Oct. 1991.) Children in San Francisco up to 72 months of age are particularly at risk due to the multiple sources of lead in the City's housing stock and in the background environment. The Board of Supervisors believes that childhood lead poisoning is the most significant environmentally caused health threat to young children living in San Francisco. 
		From March 1991 through November 1994, initial blood lead tests were received by the Department of Public Health for 7,143 children aged six to 72 months. Of these 7,143 children, 587 (8.2 percent) had elevated blood lead (EBL) levels greater than or equal to 10 µg/dL, the level at which some action must be taken to prevent further exposures according to CDC guidance. Children requiring case management included 186 children (2.6 percent of the total) with blood lead levels between 15 and 19 µg/dL and 123 children (1.7 percent of total) with blood levels greater than or equal to 20 µg/dL. The highest prevalence of EBL was 10.1 percent for one-year-olds, closely followed by a prevalence of 9.6 percent among two-year-olds. ("San Francisco Epidemiologic Bulletin," Vol. 11, Nos. 1/2, Jan/Feb. 1995.) 
		There are approximately 42,000 children in San Francisco in the age group of concern, but this number is likely to grow. At the current rate of 9,000 births per year, thousands more children will enter the age group of concern in the coming years. Census data from 1990 show significant numbers of these children living in poverty, and in properties built prior to 1950. Based on these proven risk factors, a significant proportion of San Francisco's children are at risk for lead poisoning. 
	(b)	Childhood lead poisoning is dangerous to public health, safety and general welfare. It requires large, but avoidable expenditures of public funds for health care and special education, causing a substantial, unnecessary drain on public revenues, and it reduces the ability of lead-poisoned children to become productive members of the City's work force. Recent studies show a need for remedial education for lead-poisoned children. Studies by the federal government show that the benefits of protecting children from lead poisoning are far greater than the costs needed to prevent lead poisoning and reduce lead hazards. 
	(c)	The Agency for Toxic Substances And Disease Registry has reported the following toxicological effects of lead to the U.S. Congress: "Exposure to lead continues to be a serious public health problem - particularly for the young child and the fetus. The primary target organ for lead toxicity is the brain or central nervous system, especially during early child development. In children and adults, very severe exposure can cause coma, convulsions and even death. Less severe exposure of children can produce delayed cognitive development, reduced IQ scores, and impaired hearing - even at exposure levels once thought to cause no harmful effects. Depending on the amount of lead absorbed, exposure can also cause toxic effects on the kidney, impaired regulation of vitamin D, and diminished synthesis of heme in red blood cells. All of these effects are significant. Toxicity can be persistent, and effects on the central nervous system may be irreversible." ("The Nature and Extent of Lead Poisoning in Children in the U.S.: A Report to Congress," ATSDR, July 1988.) 
		Furthermore, the ATSDR reported that in recent years, a growing number of investigators have examined the effects of exposure to low levels of lead on young children. The history of research in this field shows a progressive decline in the lowest exposure levels at which adverse health effects can be reliably detected. Thus, despite some progress in reducing the average level of lead exposure in this country, it is increasingly apparent that the scope of the childhood lead poisoning problem has been, and continues to be, much greater than was previously realized. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ("NHANES III") has shown that the remaining issues are in the nation's housing stock, particularly in urban areas and communities of color or low income status. 
	(d)	The most significant sources of environmental lead are deteriorated and disturbed lead-based paint in housing, lead-contaminated dust, water and soil. In San Francisco, approximately 75 percent or 260,000 out of some 330,000, housing units have been painted with leaded paint prior to 1978, the highest percentage of housing units in a county in California, and one of the highest number of housing units in an urban city in the entire country. The Board of Supervisors finds that these types of lead hazards are under the control of building owners and landlords who have ultimate authority over and responsibility for the condition of San Francisco's housing stock. The Board intends to require that owners of residential property built prior to 1978 warn tenants of the potential for lead paint hazards. 
	(e)	Other sources of lead in San Francisco contribute to lead poisoning of children, including lead in drinking water, some food cans, some ceramics and dishware, artists' paints, automotive and marine paints, adult occupations and hobbies, old factory sites and auto wrecking yards, soil and reentrained dust along busy roads and highways, and some traditional medicines. In addition, where lead hazards do not exist they are often created by painting and home remodeling. The Board intends to address this last hazard through requirements for signs warning of lead hazards in home improvement stores where painting and remodeling equipment is sold. 
	(f)	The impact on children from lead poisoning is immediate at high levels of exposure. At chronic low-level exposure, epidemiological studies have shown lifelong impact. The causes of childhood lead poisoning are well understood. This terribly debilitating disease is preventable and can be eliminated with concerted community action. 
	(g)	The CDC has recommended that primary prevention efforts (that is, elimination of lead hazards before children are poisoned) receive more emphasis as the blood lead levels of concern are lowered. The CDC further determined that the goal of all lead poisoning prevention activities should be to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 µg/dL. If many children in the community have blood lead levels greater than or equal to 10 µg/dL, community-wide interventions (primary prevention activities) should be considered by appropriate agencies. Medical interventions for individual children should begin at blood lead levels of 15 µg/dL. ("Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children," CDC, Oct. 1991.) 
	(h)	San Francisco has begun to implement a comprehensive plan for preventing childhood lead poisoning and reducing exposure to lead. Medical case management currently begins when a child has a blood lead level of 15 µg/dL or greater. Environmental investigation of the child's housing unit begins when blood lead levels are 20 µg/dL or greater, or 15 to 19 µg/dL in consecutive tests three to four months apart. These interventions were provided for in the Comprehensive Lead Poisoning Prevention Program added to the San Francisco Health Code in 1992. 
	(i)	The 1992 ordinance did not provide specific authority for the Department of Public Health to order control or elimination of the lead hazards in dwelling units. The Board of Supervisors was aware that protecting the public health from lead poisoning problems involves complex issues, including technological questions, that required discussion and resolution. To that end, in 1992 the Board appointed, in Section 1608 of the 1992 Ordinance, the Lead Hazard Reduction Citizens Advisory Committee. The Committee was mandated to recommend legislation to the Board on the technical and policy issues needing resolution. The Board of Supervisors concurs with the recommendations submitted by the Citizens Advisory Committee, including the recommendation that the Department of Public Health must have authority to order the removal of lead hazards, and that such authority is a necessary component of a program designed to control lead hazards that would adversely affect a child with elevated blood levels. It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors that the Director of Public Health have broad discretionary authority to enforce the mandates of this ordinance by ordering the control or elimination of lead hazards. The provisions of this law shall be liberally construed to implement and effectuate its purposes. 
	(j)	The intent of the Board is that lead hazards be controlled or eliminated in a cost-effective manner. The Board of Supervisors finds that the "Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing" produced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, provide a useful guide for the Department of Public Health to use in sampling, testing, and approving the control and elimination of lead hazards. The preface to the "Guidelines" notes that the overall framework is designed to "tailor sensible and effective hazard control programs to fit the financial and environmental conditions of specific properties." The Director of Public Health should, to the extent feasible, utilize these Guidelines and other guidance issued by federal and State agencies, to maintain the high standard of public health protection that is scientifically based and cost-effective. 
	(k)	This legislation is directed primarily at those dwelling units where a lead-poisoned child resides, has resided in the recent past, or spends a considerable amount of time. This ordinance is an integral step toward primary prevention of lead poisoning through remediation of the City's overall housing stock, and the Board intends that the Director of Public Health make diligent efforts to see that building owners and landlords and tenants receive prompt, actual notice of any identified lead hazards. The Board intends that those lead hazards that are within the control of owners or managers of buildings should be considered nuisances and subject to elimination or control whenever a lead-poisoned child is present. The Board expects that future legislation will address these issues for all properties, regardless of the age or health of the occupants. The Lead Hazard Reduction Committee's mandate includes future legislative proposals for the Board to consider towards the goal of prevention of childhood lead poisoning. 
	(l)	On May 222, 2000, the California Department of Health Services issued Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch (CLPPB) Program Letter #00-06 creating new policy which directed local Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (CLPP) Case Management Contractors to modify the case definition eligible for case management services, to include children from birth to 21 years of age. Because CLPP contractors are providing services to children in publicly funded programs (such as EPSDT, a Medicaid service), we must make our eligibility criteria consistent with other federal and state agencies that regulate and fund blood lead testing and case management services. EPSDT services are provided to eligible children from birth to 21 years of age. 
	(m)	Based on scientific evidence, such as the age of concern established by the CDC, the Director of Health is focused on reducing lead hazards to children up to 72 months of age in order to prevent lead poisoning in this vulnerable population. However, due to a contractual agreement with the State Department of Health Services for the City and County of San Francisco to provide case management services to lead-poisoned children, the Director's authority to respond to reports of lead poisoning is extended to children up to 21 years of age.

	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco that California Health & Safety Code Section 11362.5 shall be implemented with consideration for qualified users of medical cannabis, physicians, responsible and accountable providers of medical cannabis, and the police. The City and County recognizes that individuals who qualify to use medical cannabis may require the support of numerous caregivers to meet their needs for housing, health, or safety under California Health & Safety Code Section 11362.5(e). Voluntary primary caregiver cards and medical cannabis user identification cards will help peace officers identify individuals whose possession of medical cannabis is permissible under Health & Safety Code Section 11362.5. Such cards can promote cooperation between the Department of Public Health and law enforcement to protect the public welfare and medical cannabis users' rights. To further these goals, the Department of Public Health shall heed the vision, expertise, and voluntary counsel of private citizens in order to discover valuable information about the identification cards program. It also shall be the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to enable the Director of Health to take whatever steps are deemed necessary to protect the privacy of the physician-patient relationship by ensuring the confidentiality of patients' identities. Although this voluntary identification card program has no relation to any research studies, the City and County of San Francisco supports additional research on the benefits of medical cannabis and recognizes that such research must respect the confidentiality of patients and promote safeguards governing research on human subjects.

SEC. 2001.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares the following: 
	(a)	Diesel Backup Generators emit large amounts of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10), sulfur oxides and hydrocarbons contributing to ground-level ozone, and reduced visibility. 
	(b)	Diesel exhaust is linked to short and long-term adverse health effects in humans, which include lung cancer, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravation of existing asthma, acute respiratory symptoms, and chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. 
	(c)	In August of 1998, the California Air Resource Board listed diesel exhaust, specifically particulate emissions from diesel fueled engines, as a "toxic air contaminant." 
	(d)	According to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), Diesel Backup Generators tend to emit more pollutants than a new well-controlled power plant. In fact, even a clean diesel backup generator may emit more than 20 times as much NOx per kilowatt-hour as a new well-controlled power plant. Older dirtier Diesel Backup Generators may emit 200 times as much NOx. 
	(e)	The Bay Area is currently designated nonattainment for the national ozone standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
	(f)	The Bay Area is currently designated nonattainment for the state ozone and PM10 standards by the California Air Resource Board. 
	(g)	The City and County of San Francisco is concerned about the health hazards posed by diesel emissions polluting the air, and wishes to impose limitations on Diesel Backup Generators to reduce the emission of diesel exhaust.

SEC. 3100.  HUNTERS POINT SHIPYARD.
	Findings. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco hereby finds and declares as follows: 
	A.	This ordinance is designed to protect human health and safety and the environment at the former Hunters Point Shipyard during and after development and to facilitate redevelopment as envisioned in the Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment Plan, which the Board of Supervisors adopted in 1997 and amended in 2010, and its Environmental Impact Reports. 
	B.	The United States designated Hunters Point Shipyard as a U.S. Naval Shipyard in 1945. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placed the Hunters Point Shipyard on the National Priorities List pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 1989. The U.S. Navy ("Navy") has divided the site into parcels for purposes of remediation. 
	C.	The Navy issued a CERCLA Record of Decision (ROD) for Parcel A which was approved by the EPA, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), and the San Francisco Bay Region Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) in November 1995. The ROD concluded that "no action" was needed to clean up Parcel A. Effective April 5, 1999, EPA removed Parcel A from the National Priorities List after EPA and the State of California found that all appropriate responses under CERCLA had been implemented, that no further cleanup is appropriate for Parcel A and that the remedial actions conducted on Parcel A remain protective of public health, welfare, and the environment. 
	D.	On September 1, 2004, the Navy issued a draft final Finding of Suitability to Transfer (FOST) for Parcel A. On September 30th and October 6th and 7th 2004, respectively, the EPA, DTSC and the RWQCB concurred with the Navy's FOST. The Navy signed the FOST on October 14, 2004. The FOST for Parcel A contains requirements for certain notices, restrictions and covenants to be included in the deed for Parcel A. These notices, restrictions and covenants are also referred to as "institutional controls" and are binding on all successive owners of any portion of Parcel A. 
	E.	On December 3, 2004, the Navy transferred portions of Parcel A to the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.
	F.	The Navy issued a CERCLA ROD Amendment for Parcel B in January 2009, a ROD for Parcel D-1 in September 2009, a ROD for Parcel G in February 2009, a ROD for Parcel UC-1 in August 2009 and a ROD for Parcel UC-2 in December 2009. The EPA, DTSC and the RWQCB approved these RODs. The RODs concluded that additional action was needed for the parcels to be protective of public health, welfare, and the environment in light of the redevelopment plans for the site. The Navy is preparing a ROD for Parcel C and issued a Draft Proposed Plan in January 2009. The Navy issued a Draft Final No Further Action ROD for Parcel D-2 in January 2009. The Navy completed a Draft Final Remedial Investigation Report for Parcel E in February 2008 and a Draft Feasibility Study in July 2009. The Navy issued a Draft Final Remedial Investigation Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for Parcel E-2 in February 2009 and a Draft Final Radiological Addendum to the RI/FS in March 2010. The Navy issued the Final Feasibility Study for Parcel F in April 2008. 
	G.	In addition to Parcel A, which the Navy already transferred to the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency ("Agency"), it is anticipated that the Navy will offer the remaining parcels for transfer to the Agency in accordance with a Conveyance Agreement between the Agency and the Navy. Prior to transfer of any parcel, the Navy will issue a draft final FOST or a draft final Finding of Suitability for Early Transfer (FOSET) for the parcel. If the Navy issues a FOST, the Conveyance Agreement requires the Navy to obtain the concurrence of the EPA, DTSC, and RWQCB in the final FOST before it offers the parcel to the Agency. If the Navy issues a FOSET, CERCLA requires the Navy to obtain the approval of EPA and the concurrence of the Governor of California which will be based on input from DTSC and the RWQCB. A FOST or FOSET may require the deeds for the property to include certain environmental notices, restrictions or covenants, also referred to as "institutional controls" that will be binding on all successive owners of the transferred property to which such notices, restrictions or covenants apply. The Navy also is expected to enter into a Covenant to Restrict Use of Property (CRUP) with DTSC, which will be binding on subsequent owners and will provide for DTSC enforcement of the covenants, restrictions or conditions to which the property is subject. A Land Use Control Remedial Design (LUC RD) for each parcel will lay out the inspection and reporting requirements for the institutional controls and activity and land use restrictions. For property that transfers via a FOSET, the EPA and the Agency and possibly subsequent private developers, will be required to enter into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC), also approved by state environmental regulatory agencies, which will detail the required corrective or cleanup actions and restricted activities associated with the property covered by the AOC and provide for EPA enforcement of its terms. Additionally, for property that transfers via a FOSET, the Navy and the Agency will enter into an Early Transfer Cooperative Agreement (ETCA), which will provide for the Agency to cause to be performed certain environmental remediation activities to facilitate redevelopment in exchange for funding of such activities by the Navy. 
	H.	The Board of Supervisors by Resolution 347-10, adopted CEQA findings, including a mitigation monitoring and reporting program ("MMRP") for the Candlestick Point-Hunters Point Shipyard Phase II Development Plan Project ("Project"), for which the Agency and Planning Commissions certified a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") in June 3, 2010. The Project contains all of the property in the Hunters Point Shipyard except the property designated as Parcel A by the Navy. The MMRP contains mitigation measures that address potential hazardous materials impacts associated with the Project. It is the intent of the Board to create a process for the Department of Public Health to enforce in the Hunters Point Shipyard portion of the Project certain hazardous materials mitigation measures identified in the FEIR through this Article 31.

SEC. 3114.  SITE EVALUATION AND SITE MITIGATION FOR UNRESTRICTED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY.
	This section applies to property determined by the applicable ROD to be suitable for unrestricted residential use that is transferred without a requirement for a durable cover or engineered cap. 
	(a)	An Applicant must submit the following, satisfactory to the Director, as further specified in regulations adopted by the Director: (i) Site Evaluation Report; (ii) Dust Control Plan; (iii) Unknown Contaminant Contingency Plan; (iv) Disposal Plan (if applicable); (v) Site Specific Health and Safety Plan; (vi) Soil Importation Plan (if applicable), (vii) Foundation Support Piles Installation Plan (if applicable), (viii) a determination of whether additional information is necessary to adequately characterize the Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area, and (ix) for areas that undergo demolition of structures with lead based paint, a scope of work to collect additional information as described in the regulations. The plans required by (ii)-(ix) must be specific to the activities to be conducted under a permit or improvement plan. 
	The Director shall review the site evaluation report and advise the Applicant on whether additional information is necessary as follows: 
		(1)	In unrestricted residential parcels, if the Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area has already been evaluated in a Site Evaluation Report in the past and a Closure Report for the Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area was approved by the Director and the Closure Report included verification of: (i) the placement of at least one foot of clean imported fill or equivalent on areas with fill containing naturally occurring asbestos; or (ii) that the Area was cut into native bedrock and properly covered, if necessary, to address any concerns about naturally occurring asbestos; or (iii) that the Area has no naturally occurring asbestos concerns; then no site history, data evaluation, sampling or additional characterization will be necessary with respect to such Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area. 
		(2)	Unrestricted residential property that does not meet the criteria provided in subdivision (1) will be evaluated as follows:
			(A)	Tier I Areas. If a portion of a Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area has been used continuously only for residential purposes, or is not located on historic fill (as defined in a map maintained by the Director pursuant to Section 3107(e)), or is not or has not been underlain by Navy utility lines (as defined on a map maintained by the Director pursuant to Section 3107(e)), and, in any case, there is no evidence that hazardous substances are present, no additional information or sampling will be necessary with respect to such portions of the Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area. The Director shall provide the Applicant and the relevant department with written notification that the Applicant has complied with the requirements of this Article as to such portions, and must comply with the plans listed in subsection (a)(ii)-(ix), as determined by the Director to be applicable, and all laws applicable to soil removal and off-site disposal. 
			(B)	Tier II Areas. In portions of Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area other than those described as Tier I, if the Director determines that such portions are adequately characterized, the Director shall provide the Applicant and the relevant department with written notification that the Applicant has complied with the requirements of this Article as to such portions, and must comply with the plans listed in subsection (a)(ii)-(ix), as determined by the Director to be applicable, and all laws applicable to soil removal and off-site disposal. If the Director determines that additional information is necessary to adequately characterize portions of the Prescribed Subsurface Activity Area, the Applicant must submit a proposed scope of work for a supplemental site evaluation in accordance with regulations adopted by the Director. Upon approval of the scope of work by the Director, the Applicant shall implement the scope of work and prepare a supplemental site evaluation report summarizing the new information.

		(1)	The sharing of syringes is the leading source of AIDS in women and children and is also the leading cause of the transmission of the hepatitis C. 
		(2)	Medical evidence has established that providing clean syringes to injection drug users prevents the transmission of HIV and other blood borne infections while not increasing drug abuse. 
		(3)	Based on this medical data, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services advises all health care workers to counsel patients who continue to use injection drugs to use a new sterile syringe each time they prepare and inject drugs. In addition, the American Medical Association approved a resolution on June 14, 2000 "to strongly support the ability of physicians to prescribe syringes and needles to patients with injection drug addiction." (AMA House of Delegates Resolution 416, Physician Prescription of Needles to Addicted Patients.) 
		(4)	Sections 4145 and 4147 of the California Businesses and Professions Code and Section 11364 of the Health and Safety Code have been amended, and Sections 121285 et seq. of the Health and Safety Code has been added, to allow pharmacists participating in a local Disease Prevention Demonstration Project to sell or furnish 10 or fewer hypodermic needles or syringes at any one time to a person 18 years of age or older without a prescription during the period of January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010. 
		(5)	Under Section 11364 of the Health and Safety Code, as amended, no person within the physical boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco who has in their possession 10 or fewer needles or syringes for personal use obtained from an authorized source in compliance with the Section 11364(c) shall be subject to Section 11364(a) of the Health and Safety Code. 
		(6)	The Disease Prevention Demonstration Project will terminate on December 31, 2010.
		(7)	The State Department of Health Services, in conjunction with an advisory panel, will evaluate the effects of allowing the sale of hypodermic needles or syringes without prescription and will submit a report to the Governor and Legislation by January 15, 2010. 
	(b)	LOCAL DISEASE PREVENTION DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The health department shall initiate a local Disease Prevention Project satisfying the requirements for such a program as set forth in Section 121285 et seq. of the Health and Safety Code. The health department shall be responsible for the following: 
		1.	Create and maintain a registry for pharmacies located within the physical boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco desiring to participate in the Local Disease Prevention Demonstration Project, said registry to include: 
			(A)	A contact name and related information for each pharmacy.
			(B)	Certification in the form of an attestation by an individual authorized to sign on behalf of the pharmacy that at the time of furnishing or sale of hypodermic needles or syringes, the pharmacy will provide customers with written or oral information on all the following: 
				How to access drug treatment. 
				How to access testing and treatment for HIV and hepatitis C. 
				How to safely dispose of sharps waste. 
		2.	Maintain a list of all pharmacies that have registered with the department's Disease Prevention Demonstration Project. Each such registered pharmacy shall also register with the San Francisco Safe Needle Disposal Program. Pharmacies registered with the Disease Prevention Demonstration Project shall notify the department of any changes to the registration information as soon as possible under the circumstances, including notification to withdraw from the program. 
		3.	Registration information may be included in a resource directory for use by consumers and providers.
		4.	The health department shall make available to participating pharmacies written information that may be provided or reproduced to be provided in writing or orally by the pharmacy at the time of furnishing or the sale of nonprescription hypodermic needles or syringes including information on how to access drug treatment; how to access testing and treatment for HIV and hepatitis C and how to dispose of sharps waste. 
		5.	The health department shall pass regulations as it deems necessary to implement the Disease Prevention Demonstration Project.
		6.	The department's obligations under these sections are subject to the budgetary and fiscal provisions of the Charter.

HEALTHY PRODUCTS, HEALTHY CHILDREN ORDINANCE
Sec. 34.1.Findings.Sec. 34.2.Title; Preamble.Sec. 34.3.DefinitionsSec. 34.4.Prohibiting the Sale of Toys, Child Care Products and Child Feeding Products Made with Phthalates.Sec. 34.5.Least-Toxic Alternatives.Sec. 34.6.Implementation and Enforcement.Sec. 34.7.Toys, Child Care Products, and Child Feeding Products Made With Bisphenol-A.Sec. 34.8.Disclaimer.Sec. 34.9.Severability.Sec. 34.10.Suspension of Ordinance.
SEC. 34.1.  FINDINGS.
	Phthalates
	(a)	Phthalates are a family of chemicals that are used as an additive in a number of consumer products and are used to make plastics flexible for use in children's toys, shower curtains, medical supplies, and building materials. 
	(b)	Phthalate additives are not bound tightly within the plastic and may leach out of the product. Leaching may occur especially as a result of mechanical stress such as chewing or bending, and upon exposure to fats, saliva and warm temperatures. 
	(c)	Phthalates have been shown to cause reproductive harm including genital defects, sperm damage, reduced testosterone production, and premature deliveries. 
	(d)	Government agencies and scientific bodies in the European Union (EU) have recognized the potential harm of six specific types of phthalates: DEHP, DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DNOP especially to infants and young children; and as a result, these chemicals are banned from use in children's products in the EU. 
	(e)	The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has established a voluntary program to eliminate one type of phthalate, DEHP, from children's toys. 
	(f)	Studies and testing indicate that regardless of this voluntary phase-out, toys sold in the United States still contain DEHP, especially toys made from PVC plastic. 
	(g)	Consumers are not able to make informed purchasing decisions regarding children's products because there is no requirement to list phthalates content on product labels. 
	Bisphenol-A
	(h)	Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a building block of polycarbonate plastic used in such products as clear plastic baby bottles and water bottles, and in other materials such as the epoxy resin coatings that line food containers. 
	(i)	BPA has been shown to leach out of the polycarbonate plastic upon exposure to heat and mechanical scrubbing and has been detected in the liquid contained in plastic bottles that have been exposed to heat. 
	(j)	BPA mimics the hormone estrogen and is therefore considered to be an endocrine disruptor. The hormone systems of young children are uniquely susceptible to low doses of estrogenic substances. Scientific studies have shown that BPA at very low doses can affect brain chemistry and structure, behavior, the immune system, enzyme activity, the male reproductive system, and the female reproductive system in a variety of animals, including snails, fish, frogs, and mammals. 
	(k)	Scientific bodies within the US government and the European Union have concluded that animal studies such as those carried out on BPA are a vital guide to identifying health risks for humans, but have thus far concluded that no restrictions on BPA in consumer products are warranted at this time. 
	(l)	The Department of Public Health and Department of the Environment will continue to monitor emerging literature on the potential health effects of exposure to BPA. 
	(m)	Consumers are not able to make informed purchasing decisions regarding children's products because there is no requirement to list BPA content on product labels.

SEC. 34.2.  TITLE; PREAMBLE.
	(a)	This Chapter may be known as the "Healthy Products, Healthy Children Ordinance."
	(b)	In response to concerns about the scope and implementation of Ordinance No. 120-06 expressed by the San Francisco Department of Public Health following the measure's adoption in June 2006, the Board of Supervisors hereby amends the ordinance to focus on child care products and toys likely to be placed in children's mouths and containing specified phthalates and on child feeding products containing specified phthalates. The Board further urges the State of California to take action to prohibit or restrict the sale of children's products containing Bisphenol-A, and will consider further possible legislative action by the City should no such protective action be taken by the State.

SEC. 3500.  FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
	(a)	Commercial vendors are promoting Biological Agent Detectors that have not been scientifically validated to companies and institutions in San Francisco.
	(b)	"A single system that exhibits high specificity for detection of biological agents in the environment currently does not exist as a commercially available item." (Director of Homeland Security, Guide for the Selection of Biological Agent Detection for Emergency First Responders, March 2005 3.2) A lack of high specificity causes an unacceptably high rate of false alarms in biological agent detectors.
	(c)	According to a joint statement by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Director of Homeland Security, and the Centers for Disease Control, "Currently, there are no definitive field tests for identifying biological agents. Additional field testing can mislead response efforts by providing incorrect or incomplete results, and destroy limited materials critical for definitive laboratory testing required to facilitate any appropriate public health and law enforcement response." (Federal Bureau of Investigation/Director of Health Services/Centers for Disease Control Coordinated Document; Guidance on Initial Responses to a Suspicious Letter/Container – November 2, 2004)
	(d)	Biological Agent Detectors that are commercially available have not been scientifically validated or approved for use by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).
	(e)	The currently available technology and protocols to confirm the presence or absence a bioterrorism attack are not well developed, which may result in prolonged and unnecessary closure of the identified facility and nearby buildings. (United States Government Accountability Office, Report to the Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations, House Committee on Government Reform, House of Representatives. Anthrax detection:  Agencies need to validate sampling activities in order to increase confidence in negative results. March 2006)
	(f)	A false alarm of a possible bioterrorism attack may cause civil unrest, business disruptions, prolonged facility closure, and mental health consequences.
	(g)	Prolonged closure of facilities and adjacent buildings to perform environmental sampling may cause extended work stoppage and significant financial loss to businesses.
	(h)	An estimated cost to the City and County of San Francisco in responding to a false alarm of a Biological Agent Detector is over $700,000 per incident, with an additional $200,000 for each additional day of emergency response and restoration activities. The costs may include decontamination, environmental sampling, law enforcement, laboratory testing, public health surveillance, and facility restoration.
	(i)	The City and County of San Francisco has a response plan for the federal Director of Homeland Security Biowatch program that continuously collects air samples to test for key bioterrorism agents and uses a CDC-coordinated Laboratory Response Network for testing and confirmation. The Laboratory Response Network program has been scientifically validated by the CDC.
	(j)	Emergency responders of the City and County of San Francisco use a Suspicious Substance Response Plan. With guidance from this response plan, emergency responders systematically assess the threats, potential risks, and the appropriate screening tests. If determined to be appropriate, the emergency responders or the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) would collect the substance for testing at the CDC-coordinated Laboratory Response Network (LRN) reference laboratory at the California Department of Public Health. Using scientifically validated testing procedures, the LRN can produce reliable and validated test results within several hours.
	(k)	The San Francisco Director of Public Health and health professionals use medical and public health surveillance to detect any cases of bioterrorism.
	(l)	For these reasons, the City and County of San Francisco strongly discourages the purchase and use of Biological Agent Detectors by public institutions and businesses in San Francisco.
	(m)	If the National Science & Technology Council develops national equipment performance standards for biological agent detectors, the Department of Public Health shall make recommendation to the Board of Supervisors regarding whether to amend or repeal this legislation.

SEC. 3802.  FINDINGS.
	(a)	Motor vehicles are a major source of air pollution in the United States, particularly in urban areas;
	(b)	Pollution from motor vehicles imposes severe health burdens on children and families living near freeways and busy roadways. Health research has consistently shown that persons living in close proximity to freeways or busy roadways have poorer lung functions and are more susceptible to develop asthma and other respiratory problems, compared with persons living at a greater distance; 
	(c)	To avoid the health problems associated with exposure to roadway pollution, the California Air Resources Board recommends avoiding the placement of residential and other sensitive uses within 500 feet (approximately 150 meters) of busy freeways and other busy roadways. However, significant residential development in the state is occurring in urban infill sites, near freeways or busy arterial roadways, potentially increasing these residents' exposure to air pollutants and their associated health risks; and 
	(d)	This situation is exacerbated in the City of San Francisco, which, by virtue of being located on a peninsula, has a limited amount of land available for new residential development.

	(d)	"Local Roadway Traffic Sources" means traffic generated on roadways within 500 feet from the site.
	(e)	"PM 2.5" means solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air, that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.
