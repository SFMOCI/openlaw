	Beginning with ordinances passed in 2011, all ordinances affecting this Code are summarized in a table that lists the identifying information (ordinance and file numbers), effective date, short title, and sections affected for each such ordinance. Users should note that the operative date of an ordinance may be later than the effective date of the ordinance. A delayed operative date will be noted in the ordinance.

SEC. 2.01.  "PARK" DEFINED.
	(a)	When used in this Code, the word "park" shall mean and include all grounds, roadways, avenues, squares, recreation facilities, and other property placed under the control, management and direction of the Recreation and Park Commission by the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco, and the open space on the blocks bounded by Market, Folsom, Third and Fourth Streets which is under the control, management and direction of the Redevelopment Agency of the City and County of San Francisco, otherwise known as the "Yerba Buena Gardens," unless such word is otherwise defined within the section in which it appears. 
	(b)	When used in Articles 3, 4 and 7 of this Code, the word "park" shall also include the area comprising Fulton Street between Hyde and Market Streets and Leavenworth Street between McAllister and Fulton Streets, which area was closed to vehicular traffic by San Francisco Board of Supervisors Resolution No. 373-73 and is otherwise known as United Nations Plaza, and the area that is bounded by the northwesterly line of Market Street, the southerly line of Eddy Street and the westerly line of Lot 13, Assessor's Block 341, and is otherwise known as Hallidie Plaza. The designation of United Nations Plaza and Hallidie Plaza as parks for purposes of Articles 3, 4 and 7 of this Code does not effect a jurisdictional transfer of these plazas, does not place these plazas under the jurisdiction and control of the Recreation and Park Commission and does not render these plazas "park land" or "park property" as those terms are used in any provision of the San Francisco Charter. 
	(c)	When used in this Code, the word "park" also shall include portions of property owned by the State of California immediately under and adjacent to the portions of the Central Freeway located between Otis and Stevenson Streets and between Valencia and Stevenson Streets and partially bounded by Duboce Avenue referred to as "SoMa West Skatepark and Dog Park," to the extent such property is (1) leased by the City under leases with the State of California, acting by and through its Department of Transportation, authorized under San Francisco Board of Supervisors Resolution No. 160-13 and Resolution No. 161-13, and (2) depicted in such leases as the "skatepark" and the "dog park." The word "park" shall not include the portion of the leased property depicted in such leases as the "parking area." In designating SoMa West Skatepark and Dog Park as a "park" for purposes of this Code, the Board of Supervisors does not intend to place the leased property under the jurisdiction and control of the Recreation and Park Commission within the meaning of Charter Section 4.113, dedicate any of the leased property as "park land" or "park property" as those terms are used in any provision of the San Francisco Charter, or impose this Code on the State of California or its employees, agents, or contractors while engaging in the course and scope of their employment on the leased property. Rather, the intent is to authorize the Recreation and Park Department to manage the SoMa West Skatepark and Dog Park for the Real Estate Division for recreational use by the public and enforce the provisions of this Code on uses of the SoMa West Skatepark and Dog Park by the public, only while the leases referred to herein remain in effect.

SEC. 6.12.  DISABILITY ACCESS STANDARDS AND AUTHORIZED VEHICULAR TRAFFIC USE FOR GOLDEN GATE PARK DURING SUNDAY ROAD CLOSURES.
	(a)	Findings and Purpose.
		(i)	Golden Gate Park was created more than 100 years ago to provide a sanctuary from the pressures of urban life. Golden Gate Park remains an irreplaceable resource of open space for visitors to and residents of San Francisco, especially those families for whom it is difficult to travel out of the City for recreation. 
		(ii)	For more than 30 years, Sunday and holiday closure to motor vehicles of a portion of John F. Kennedy Drive, approximately 1.5 miles in length, between Kezar Drive and Transverse Drive, and closure of portions of adjacent roads connecting with that portion of John F. Kennedy Drive, has been one of the most popular attractions in Golden Gate Park, attracting hundreds of thousands of people each year from every neighborhood, racial/ethnic group, age category, and income level. 
		(iii)	Proposition J. the Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act of 1998, adopted by San Francisco voters on June 2, 1998, has as one of its primary purposes to take steps to reduce the impact of automobiles in Golden Gate Park while still providing long-term assurance of safe, reliable, and convenient access for visitors to the Park. This goal remains of paramount importance in ensuring that Golden Gate Park is scenically beautiful, environmentally sensitive, culturally diverse, and accessible to all. 
		(iv)	Concerns about ensuring automobile access to the cultural institutions in the Golden Gate Park Concourse area, including the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum and the California Academy of Sciences ("CAS"), have been addressed by the construction of an underground parking garage in the Concourse area pursuant to the aforementioned Proposition J. 
	(b)	Disability Access Standards. The following disability access standards shall apply to the Sunday and holiday road closures of John K. Kennedy Drive and related roads. 
		(i)	Disability access to Golden Gate Park shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act of 1998. 
		(ii)	All vehicular access points to the areas of closure shall contain directional signage that describes all access points and accessible surface parking areas for people with disabilities and provides directions to the underground parking facility in the Music Concourse. Signage also shall include telephone and TTY/TDD contact numbers where callers can obtain information on disability access during the road closure periods. 
		(iii)	The Department, in consultation with the Department of Parking and Traffic, Fine Arts Museums, Golden Gate Park Concourse Authority, and Mayor's Office on Disability, shall explore and adopt disability access measures. Such measures may include, but are not limited to: 
			(A)	The provision of eight (8) accessible parking spaces on 8th Avenue between Fulton Street and John F. Kennedy Drive during the closure period. 
			(B)	An additional ten (10) accessible parking spaces to assist with access to the road closure areas.
			(C)	A signed drop-off zone for people with disabilities on Bowling Green Drive as close as practicable to its intersection with John F. Kennedy Drive. 
			(D)	An authorized intra-park transit shuttle that is accessible and operates frequently on the closed sections of John F. Kennedy Drive, additional accessible parking spaces and additional signed drop-off zones for people with disabilities outside of the area of closure. 
	(c)	Exempt Motor Vehicles. The following motor vehicles are exempt from the Sunday road closures: 
		(i)	Emergency vehicles, including but not limited to police and fire vehicles;
		(ii)	Official City, State, or federal vehicles, or any other authorized vehicle, being used to perform official City, State, or federal business pertaining to Golden Gate Park or any property or facility therein, including but not limited to vehicles of the Recreation and Park Department and construction vehicles authorized by the Recreation and Park Department; and 
		(iii)	Authorized intra-park transit shuttle buses or similar authorized vehicles used to transport persons within Golden Gate Park.
	(d)	Emergency Authority. The General Manager of the Recreation and Park Department shall have the authority to allow traffic on roads that would otherwise be closed in accordance with this Section in circumstances which in the General Manager's judgment constitute an emergency such that the benefit to the public from the street closure is outweighed by traffic burden or public safety hazard created by the emergency circumstances.

		(ii)	The public interest will be served by a Saturday closure of John F. Kennedy Drive, between Transverse Drive and the western side of Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive, and closure of Stow Lake Drive East connecting with that portion of John F. Kennedy Drive. 
		(iii)	Saturday road closures are necessary for the safety and protection of persons who would use these roads during the closures.
	(b)	Saturday Road Closures. The following roads in Golden Gate Park shall be closed to motor vehicle traffic on Saturdays, from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time and Pacific Daylight Time, subject to the inclement weather condition protocols that apply to the current Sunday road closures: John F.

		(ii)	Vehicle deliveries to the DeYoung Museum loading dock during the Saturday and Sunday closure are specifically acknowledged and authorized herein. Such vehicles shall have unimpeded access to the Museum's loading dock from John F. Kennedy Drive through the road closure area. The DeYoung Museum shall develop appropriate protocols that provide for unencumbered delivery access to its loading dock and maintain safety of individuals within the road closure area. The Museum shall evaluate such protocols and delivery activities on a regular basis to ensure that adequate delivery access and public safety are maintained. If necessary, the Recreation and Park Department, in consultation with the Mayor's Office, shall institute additional or modified methods that ensure adequate delivery access to the Museum and public safety. 
		(iii)	The Recreation and Park Department, in consultation with the Mayor's Office on Disability, shall develop appropriate signage for the Saturday Road closure to minimize any traffic disruption. 
	(d)	Effect on Sunday and Holiday Road Closures. This Section is not intended to have any effect on street closures in Golden Gate Park on Sundays and holidays except for the provisions of subsection (c)(ii) concerning delivery access to the DeYoung Museum's loading dock. 
	(e)	Conflict With Other Provisions of Law. If any provision of this Section conflicts with an earlier enacted provision of this Article or of any other earlier enacted provision of law, and the conflict cannot be reasonably reconciled, the provision of this Section shall govern. 
	(f)	Severability. If any provision, sentence, clause, or other part of this Section is held to be invalid or unlawful, such a holding shall not limit or abrogate other parts of this Section that can be given effect independently of the invalid or unlawful provision, sentence, clause, or part.

Such conditions may be imposed on a permittee after the permit application has been approved if information is received by the General Manager after such approval which would provide reasonable grounds for the conclusion that further conditions are necessary, including the condition that the location of the proposed activity be changed. The provisions of this Section are designed to secure for permit holders an opportunity fully to exercise the rights conferred upon them by the permit without unreasonably interfering with the rights of other members of the public to use park property and adjacent areas or to engage in First Amendment activities. The General Manager shall in no event impose conditions pursuant to this Section which are designed to limit the content of First Amendment expression engaged in by persons affected by the permit or which unreasonably interfere with the right of free speech. 
	(b)	The conditions which may be imposed on permit applicants include the following: (1) posting a performance bond to insure that property is restored and cleaned at the conclusion of the permitted activity; (2) providing insurance to protect the City from liability from any harm that such activity might cause; and (3) agreeing to reimburse the Recreation and Park Department for any costs incurred by it in restoring damage to property, caused by the actions of the permittee, its officers, employees, or agents, or any person who was, or reasonably should have been, under the permittee's control and to defend the City against, and indemnify and hold the City harmless from, any liability to any person resulting from any damage or injury caused by the actions of the permittee, its officers, employees, or agents, or any person who was or reasonably should have been, under the permittee's control.

	(d)	No applicant shall be required to comply with the provisions of Subsection (b)(2) pertaining to insurance if the activity proposed is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the applicant produces evidence that complying with those provisions is impossible or so financially burdensome that it would preclude the applicant from using park property for the proposed activity.

	(d)	The proposed activity is inconsistent with the purpose for which the facility or area has been established or designated;

	(f)	The applicant fails to obtain necessary approvals, permits, or licenses from other governmental departments or agencies;
	(g)	The applicant has not complied with the procedural requirements established by Commission resolution for the filing of permit applications;
