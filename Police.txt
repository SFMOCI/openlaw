SEC. 1.1.  CLIPPER COVE SPECIAL-USE AREA.
	(a)	Special-Use Area. In order to promote the recreational use of Clipper Cove, reduce existing and potential conflicts among recreational users of Clipper Cove, protect the overall public health and safety of users of the Cove, and to eliminate adverse environmental impacts to the San Francisco Bay, Clipper Cove is hereby designated a Special-Use Area as that term is defined and used in California's Harbors and Navigation Code (see, California Harbors and Navigation Code §§ 651, 660).
	(b)	Clipper Cove Defined. For the purposes of Section 1.1 of this Code, Clipper Cove is defined as that section of San Francisco Bay bounded by the south shore of Treasure Island, the north shore of Yerba Buena Island, and the connecting causeway, west of a line extending from the southeast corner of the finger pier known as "Pier 1" along the east side of Treasure Island, at about latitude 37 [degrees] 49' 11", longitude 122 [degrees] 21' 40", approximately 153 [degrees] 20' to the northeasterly point of Yerba Buena Island, at about latitude 37 [degrees] 48' 55", longitude 122 [degrees] 21' 30".

		(3)	Not less than 72 hours prior to removing a vessel moored or anchored in violation of this Section 1.1, TIDA or its designee shall securely attach to the vessel a distinctive notice stating that the vessel will be removed for violation of this Section 1.1.
		(4)	Within 48 hours after the removal of a vessel pursuant to this Section 1.1, excluding weekends and holidays, TIDA or its designee must send notice of removal of the vessel by certified or first-class mail: to the registered and legal owners, if known or discovered before or after the removal, at their addresses of record with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the National Vessel Documentation Center, and to any other person that TIDA or its designee knows has an interest in the vessel.

			(G)	A statement that the registered or legal owners or any other person known to have an interest in the property shall have the opportunity for a post-removal hearing before TIDA or its designee to determine the validity of the removal and storage, if a request for a hearing is made to TIDA or its designee in person, by telephone, by email or by regular mail within 10 days from the date of notice; and that if the registered or legal owner or any other person known to have an interest in the property disagrees with the decision of TIDA or its designee after the hearing, he or she may seek review of the decision of TIDA or its designee pursuant to Government Code § 11523 and Harbors and Navigation Code § 526(b)(7) or their successor provisions.

The failure of either the registered or legal owners or any other person known to have an interest in the property to request or attend a scheduled hearing shall not affect the validity of the hearing.
		(7)	TIDA shall be responsible for the costs incurred for removal and storage if it is determined in the post-storage hearing that valid grounds for the removal and storage were not established.

(Added by Ord. 76-87, App. 3/20/87)
SEC. 39-1.  PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR SPECIFIED LITTERING AND NUISANCE VIOLATIONS.
	(a)	This Section shall govern the imposition, assessment and collection of administrative penalties imposed pursuant to Sections 37, 38 and 63 of the Police Code, Sections 41.13, 283.1, 287, 288.1 and 600 of the Health Code, and Sections 170, 173, 174, 174.2, and 724.5 of the Public Works Code. 
	(b)	The Board of Supervisors finds:
		(1)	That it is in the best interest of the City and its citizens to provide an alternative, administrative penalty mechanism for enforcement of the littering and nuisance violations covered by this section in addition to the existing enforcement mechanisms authorized under the California Penal Code; and 
		(2)	That the administrative penalty scheme established by this section is not intended to be punitive in nature, but is instead intended to compensate the public for the injury and damage caused by the prohibited conduct. The administrative penalties authorized under this section are intended to be reasonable and not disproportionate to the damage or injury to the City and the public caused by the prohibited conduct. 
	(c)	Administrative Citation. Where an officer or employee designated in Section 38 determines that there has been a violation of a local litter or nuisance law that authorizes imposition of an administrative penalty, the officer or employee may issue an administrative citation to the person and/or entity responsible for the violation. For purposes of this Section, an entity is responsible if an officer, employee or agent of the entity commits the violation. The citation shall inform the person or entity responsible of the date, time, place and nature of the violation and the amount of the proposed penalty, and shall state that the penalty is due and payable to the City Treasurer within 15 City business days from the date of the notice, if not contested within the time period specified. The citation shall also state that the person or entity responsible has the right, pursuant to Subsection (d), to request administrative review of the citing officer or employee's determination as to the violation and assessment of penalties, and shall set forth the procedure for requesting administrative review. The Director shall serve the administrative citation as follows: 
		1.	Where there is a nexus between the violator and a specific property:
			(A)  	One copy of the Notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the building or property. 
			(B)  	One copy of the Notice shall be served upon each of the following: 
				(i)  	The person, if any, in real or apparent charge and control of the premises or property involved; 
				(ii)  	The owner of record. 
				Service required by subparagraph (B) may be made by personal service or by certified mail. 
		2.	Where the issuing officer or employee is unable to ascertain a nexus between the violation and property within the City, a completed copy of the administrative citation may be served on the individual who has committed the violation by personal service or by certified mail. 
		3.	For purposes of this Section, there is a nexus where activity on the property has caused, contributed to, or been a substantial factor in causing, the violation. 
	(d)	Request for Hearing; Hearing.
		(1)	A person or entity that has been issued an administrative citation may request administrative review in order to contest the citation issued in accordance with this section. Administrative review shall be initiated by filing a request for administrative review with the Director of Public Works within 15 City business days from the date of the citation. Failure to request a hearing within the time specified in the citation shall be deemed an admission that the cited person or entity committed the violation identified in the administrative citation. 
		(2)	Whenever administrative review is requested pursuant to this Section, the Director of Public Works shall, within five City business days of receipt of the request, notify the requestor of the date, time, and place of the administrative review hearing by certified mail. Such hearing shall be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the Director receives the request, unless time is extended by mutual agreement of the affected parties. 
		(3)	The administrative review hearing shall be conducted by a neutral hearing of officer from outside the Department of Public Works and the department whose employee issued the citation, assigned by the Director of Administrative Services. The Director of Administrative Services may issue rules as needed to implement this requirement. The parties may present evidence and testimony to the hearing officer. All testimony shall be under oath. The hearing officer shall ensure that a record of the proceedings is maintained. The burden of proof to uphold the violation shall be on the City, but the administrative citation shall be prima facie evidence of the violation. 
		(4)	The hearing officer shall issue a decision including a summary of the issues and the evidence presented, and findings and conclusions, within ten (10) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing. The hearing officer may uphold the penalty imposed by the citation, reduce the penalty, or dismiss the citation. A copy of the decision shall be served by certified mail upon the person or entity contesting the violation. The decision shall be a final administrative determination. An aggrieved party may seek judicial review of the decision pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6. 
	(e)	Payment and Collection of Penalty.
		(1)	Where a person or entity has not made a timely request for administrative review, the penalty shall be due and payable to the City Treasurer on or before 15 City business days from the date of issuance. 
		(2)	Where a person or entity has made a timely request for administrative review, and the penalty has been upheld in whole or in part upon review, any administrative penalty imposed by the hearing officer shall be due and payable not later than ten City business days from the date of the notice of decision issued under subparagraph (d)(4). 
		(3)	If a penalty due and payable under paragraphs (1) or (2) remains unpaid after the specified due date, the Director of Public Works shall send the violator written notice that the penalty is overdue. Penalties that remain unpaid 30 days after the due date shall be subject to a late payment penalty of ten percent (10%) plus interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the outstanding balance, which shall be added to the penalty amounts from the date that payment is due. Persons and entities against whom administrative penalties are imposed shall also be liable for the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the City and County in bringing any civil action to enforce the provisions of this section, including obtaining a judgment for the amount of the administrative penalty and other costs and charges. 
		(4)	Where there is a nexus between the violation and property in the City owned by the violator, the Director shall further inform the violator that if the amount due is not paid within 30 days from the date of the notice, the Director shall initiate proceedings to make the amount due and all additional authorized costs and charges, including attorneys fees, a lien on the property. Such liens shall be imposed in accordance with Chapter 10, Article XX of the Administrative Code. 
	(f)	The revenues generated by penalties from an administrative citation issued pursuant to this Section may be expended only by the department that is responsible for issuing the administrative citation, except that each department other than Public Works that issues administrative citations pursuant to this Section shall reimburse the Department of Public Works for the costs incurred by the Department of Public Works in administering review of those citations issued by the other department. The revenues from administrative citations issued by Class 8280 Environmental Control Officers and 8282 Senior Environmental Control Officers may be expended exclusively by the Department of Public Works for the purpose of funding litter enforcement and abatement except where the use or expenditure of those revenues is specifically directed by law to another program within the Department of Public Works.

(Amended by Ord. 523-83, App. 11/4/83)
SEC. 65.  OBSTRUCTING PASSENGER LOADING ZONES.
	(a)	Findings.
		(1)	San Francisco is a dense, urban environment that, like many large cities, experiences both heavy motor vehicle traffic on streets and heavy pedestrian traffic on sidewalks, particularly in areas with concentrated commercial businesses and other facilities open to the public.
		(2)	Reducing traffic congestion on City streets and maintaining a smooth flow of pedestrian traffic and access to authorized commercial businesses and other facilities on public sidewalks are essential to public safety, thriving neighborhoods and a vital economy in the City.
		(3)	The need to control pedestrian and commercial traffic is greatest during the hours of operation of businesses, shops, restaurants, and other organizations and commercial enterprises, when streets and public sidewalks are congested, and when City residents are most likely to use their neighborhood sidewalks.
		(4)	Various entities, including for example, restaurants, hotels, apartment buildings, schools, religious institutions, health care facilities, and adult and child day care facilities, have significant numbers of customers or patrons who are picked up or dropped off by motor vehicles. These entities may request that the City, through its Municipal Transportation Agency (''MTA"), establish a "white zone," which is a passenger loading area at the street curb fronting the entity. White zones require payment of a fee, a public hearing and approval by the City's Traffic Engineer.
		(5)	By facilitating access to businesses, shops, organizations and services, white zones reduce the number of vehicles double parked on City streets and obviate the need for drivers to circle blocks in search of a parking space in order to drop off or pick up passengers. White zones serve an important role in reducing traffic congestion, improving vehicular and pedestrian safety, and reducing motor vehicle emissions.
		(6)	An individual's placement of physical items, including, but not limited to, materials, objects, substances, or articles of personal property on a white zone curb or on a sidewalk adjacent to a white zone, can prevent or impede a passenger's ability to enter or exit a vehicle stopped in the white zone, or his or her unobstructed passage across the sidewalk between the white zone and the adjacent building, which in turn endangers the safety of motor vehicle passengers and other members of the public seeking to use these zones, especially seniors, individuals with a disability, including individuals with mobility, vision, or hearing impairments, and children and their parents or guardians, and frustrates the very purposes of the white zone.
		(7)	Existing laws that prohibit the intentional, willful or malicious obstruction of pedestrians on sidewalks do not adequately address the safety hazards, disruption and impediments to pedestrian and vehicular traffic that blocking access to white zones and sidewalks adjacent to white zones causes.
	(b)	Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
		(1)	''Adjacent Sidewalk" shall mean that portion of a sidewalk located next to a White Zone Curb, and extending across the sidewalk to the back of curb line as depicted in the City's official record of sidewalk widths, bounded at either end of the White Zone Curb by a line perpendicular to the curb and extending to the back of curb line as depicted in the City's official record of sidewalk widths.
		(2)	''Business or Facility" shall mean any commercial, noncommercial, or nonprofit enterprise providing goods or services, including, but not limited to, stores, shops, offices, schools, religious institutions, places of entertainment, health care facilities, child and adult day care facilities, hotels, and apartment buildings. Except for public schools and public health care facilities, ''Business or Facility" shall not include any building owned by a governmental entity and used for governmental purposes.
		(3)	"Obstruct" shall mean to either: a) place any physical items, including, but not limited to, materials, objects, substances, or articles of personal property on a White Zone Curb or an Adjacent Sidewalk; or b) suspend any physical items, including, but not limited to, materials, objects, or articles of personal property over a White Zone Curb or an Adjacent Sidewalk so that the lowest edge of the material, object or article is at a height of less than seven feet above the White Zone Curb or Adjacent Sidewalk. For purposes of this Section, a person, and anything worn or carried by a person, shall not constitute an obstruction.
		(4)	"White Zone Curb" shall mean the curbside edge of a sidewalk designated as a passenger loading zone that the Municipal Transportation Agency has painted white.
	(c)	Prohibition. It shall be unlawful to Obstruct a White Zone Curb or Adjacent Sidewalk in front of any Business or Facility at any time during which use of the parking space adjacent to the White Zone Curb is restricted to passenger loading and unloading.
	(d)	Exceptions. The prohibition in Subsection (c) shall not apply to the placement of:
		(1)	Any property placed on or affixed to an Adjacent Sidewalk by a governmental entity, a public utility, or the Joint Pole Authority, including but not limited to telephone, electrical and light poles, traffic control and directional signs and devices, parking meters, fire hydrants, emergency call boxes, United States Postal Service mail receptacles or boxes, public transportation shelters, benches and identifying signs, bicycle racks, and bicycles stored in such racks;
		(2)	Any property or equipment that the City authorizes in accordance with the Public Works Code or under any permit from, or regulations or orders issued by, the Director of Public Works;
		(3)	Physical items on a White Zone Curb or Adjacent Sidewalk in the course of operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on an Adjacent Sidewalk pursuant to a sidewalk use permit;
		(4)	Physical items on a White Zone Curb or Adjacent Sidewalk in the course of participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, or similar event conducted in the street or on a public sidewalk pursuant to and in compliance with a street use or other applicable permit; or
		(5)	Any personal property required by a person for personal mobility or medical purposes.
	(e)	Notification. A peace officer may not cite a person for violating this Section unless the person engages in conduct this Section prohibits after a peace officer has notified the person that the conduct violates this Section.
	(f)	Penalty. Any person violating Subsection (c) of this Section shall be guilty of an infraction and shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) for a first violation, two hundred dollars ($200) for a second violation of Subsection (c) within a year of a first violation, and five hundred dollars ($500) for each additional violation of Subsection (c) within a year of a first violation.
	(g)	Other laws and orders. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to permit willfully and substantially obstructing the free passage on the sidewalk of any person in violation of State or local law.
	(h)	Disclaimer. In undertaking the adoption and implementation of this Ordinance, the City is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. The City is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its officer and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach proximately caused injury.
	(i)	Severability. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this Section be for any reason declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or the effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Section or any part thereof.

SEC. 94.  FORECLOSURE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.*
	Title. This Section shall be known as the Foreclosure Responsibility and Accountability Ordinance.
(Added by Ord. 212-12, File No. 120318, App. 10/9/2012, Eff. 11/8/2012)
(Former Sec. 94 added by Ord. 1.075, App. 10/11/38; repealed by Ord. 14-02, File No. 011845, App. 2/8/2002)
SEC. 94.1.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.*
	(a)	San Francisco is still seeing a significant number of foreclosures. According to the San Francisco Assessor/Recorder's fiscal year 2010-2011 Annual Report, there were 2,277 notices of default recorded in residential, commercial and industrial properties. This statistic represents an average of 184 recorded notices of default per month, up 171% from five years ago.
	(b)	In addition, there were 927 actual foreclosures in the 2010-2011 fiscal year or an average of 83 per month. This figure represents a 3% increase from the previous fiscal year, and an 1128% increase from five years ago when foreclosures averaged 7 per month.
	(c)	The majority of foreclosures in San Francisco are non-judicial foreclosures. A non-judicial foreclosure allows a lender to sell a property to pay off an existing debt, assuming the lender is authorized to foreclose and that all the requisite procedures are followed. Often, by the time the foreclosure process has concluded, the foreclosed property is in a state of disrepair, often suffering from deferred maintenance and neglect and needing significant repairs.
	(d)	Once a foreclosure has concluded, properties can remain in a state of disrepair for months, even years. Often, a foreclosing owner, despite having the resources and ability to abate the conditions, chooses to leave the property in its current state subjecting tenants and the surrounding community and neighbors to the effects of this neglect: further deteriorating conditions such as mold, lack of heat and hot water, peeling paint, overgrown vegetation, vulnerability to squatters, blight, and other nuisance.
	(e)	The City recognizes the importance in a dense, urban environment of the need to ensure that properties are maintained in a healthy and safe condition, free of nuisances and blight and therefore it is the policy of the City that all Departments consider enforcement of this Ordinance a high priority. By holding owners of foreclosed properties responsible for maintaining their properties and increasing the potential consequences errant owners face for permitting nuisances to continue, the City can more effectively ensure that its neighborhoods are healthy and sate for those who choose to live, work or visit.

	(b)	"Public Nuisance" includes any condition that is defined as a public nuisance under California state law including California Civil Code Sections 3479 and 3480. "Public Nuisance" also includes any condition declared by the San Francisco Municipal Code to be a public nuisance.
	(c)	"Person" shall include, but is not limited to:

ARTICLE 1.2
DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING AGAINST FAMILIES WITH MINOR CHILDREN
Sec. 100.Findings.Sec. 101.Definition: Housing Accommodation.Sec. 102.Prohibited Activity.Sec. 103.Occupancy Standards.Sec. 104.Tenant Age Policy Not Prohibited.Sec. 105.Requirements of Financial Obligations Not Prohibited.Sec. 106.Penalty.Sec. 107.Civil Action.Sec. 107.1.Liability.Sec. 107.2.Injunctive Relief.Sec. 107.3.Administrative Remedies.Sec. 107.4.Limitation on Actions.Sec. 107.5.Bar.Sec. 108.Severance Clause.
SEC. 100.  FINDINGS.
	After public hearings with the reception of testimony and documentary evidence, we find that discrimination against families with minor children in the leasing or renting of housing accommodations exists within the City and County of San Francisco. We further find that the existence of such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the health and welfare of a sizable segment of the community, namely families with minor children. 
	We find that a shortage of housing suitable for families with minor children exists within the City and County. We further find that a low vacancy rate exists in all rental housing throughout San Francisco. The addition of discrimination against families with minor children to the above two factors creates an untenable situation for the children of San Francisco. 
	We find that existing state and local laws prohibiting housing discrimination against families with children have not stopped acts of discrimination. Some landlords have attempted to circumvent these laws by engaging in subtle forms of discrimination that do not overtly exclude families with children but that nonetheless limit their opportunities to rent. Some landlords use overly restrictive occupancy standards to limit the number of persons who can reside in a rental unit. These standards have an adverse effect on the ability of families with children to rent because families with children tend to have a larger number of persons per household than childless households. Other forms of subtle discrimination include rent surcharges for additional occupants of a unit and unreasonable rules governing children's conduct in and around the rental unit. 
	The overall effect of such discrimination is to encourage the flight of families from the City and to further diminish family-oriented neighborhoods. It has an overall detrimental effect on the composition of the City, the stability of neighborhoods, the preservation of family life within the City, the living conditions of our children, the quality of our schools, and the viability of children's activities and organizations. 
	This discrimination cuts across all racial, ethnic and economic levels but has a disproportionate and adverse effect on racial and ethnic minority families.

	It shall be unlawful for the owner, lessor, lessee, sublessee, real estate broker, assignee, or other person having the rights of ownership, the right of possession, or the right to rent or lease any housing accommodations, or any agent or employee of such person to: 
	(a)	Refuse to rent or lease, or otherwise deny to or withhold from any person such accommodations because such person has a minor child or children who shall occupy the leased or rented premises with such person; 
	(b)	Represent to any person because of the potential tenancy of a minor child or children that housing accommodations are not available for inspection or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available;

	(g)	Charge additional rent, deposits, fees, or surcharges on the basis of actual or potential number or age of persons living in the housing accommodations; 
	(h)	Establish unreasonable rules for, or conditions of, occupancy of housing accommodations which have the effect of excluding or discriminating against persons with children. Examples of unreasonable rules include, but are not limited to, the following: 
		(1)	Restricting the hours during which minor children but not adults may use recreational facilities on the property;
		(2)	Requiring that minor children who are six years of age or older be accompanied by a parent or other adult when using common areas which are accessible to all tenants and which do not present any unusual hazards; 
		(3)	Limiting the occupancy of persons with children to certain units, floors or areas of an apartment building; and
		(4)	Prohibiting children of the opposite sex from sharing the same bedroom.
	Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a property owner or other person having the right to rent or lease any housing accommodations from adopting reasonable policies or practices regulating the use of the accommodations or its common areas, facilities, and services even though those policies and practices have the effect of excluding persons with children. A policy or practice is reasonable, under this subsection, if it fulfills a business necessity. Business necessity is demonstrated by independent and objective evidence that the policy or practice in question serves a legitimate and nondiscriminatory business purpose and is essential to the safe and continued operation of the business.

SEC. 109.1.  PURPOSE.
	The passage of Proposition 13, the property tax reform measure on June 6, 1978 ballot, has meant substantial property tax decreases to most landlords in the City and County of San Francisco. Through the use of a Renters Hot Line and public hearings, it has been found that a substantial number of landlords have increased the rents of tenants, and few have decreased rents, despite the passage of Proposition 13. 
	The Board of Supervisors will be considering the feasibility and desirability of measures designed to address the problems created by the unjustified spiraling rents in the City and County of San Francisco. Pending further study of the development and adoption of measures to address the problems created by the unjustified rent increases, it is necessary to temporarily roll back rents and, through June 14, 1979, to prohibit most rental increases on rental residential units within the City and County of San Francisco.

SEC. 120-2.  AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION BAN/ SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM.
	(a)	Findings. The people of San Francisco find that the problems of aggressive and improper solicitation are among the most difficult and vexing faced by the City and that prior approaches mostly have failed. 
		The people of San Francisco find that aggressive solicitation for money in public and private places threatens residents' and visitors' safety, privacy and quality of life. San Franciscans seek policies that preserve citizens' right to enjoy public spaces free from fear and harassment while protecting the free speech rights of individuals and groups, permitting appropriate and safe commercial activities of street artisans, performers and merchants and providing for the basic needs of indigent and vulnerable populations. Where appropriate, San Franciscans also seek to establish policies and programs that limit the ability of indigent and homeless substance abusers to use cash contributions for the purchase of alcohol and illegal drugs. 
		The people of San Francisco find that the City's existing laws regulating panhandling and solicitation are outdated and unenforceable as a result of numerous court decisions and criminalize violators instead of diverting them to screening and assessment for eligibility in drug and alcohol dependency and mental health treatment programs. 
		The people of San Francisco find that people who aggressively or improperly solicit because of drug or alcohol dependency or mental illness should be diverted from the criminal court system to a program of screening, assessment and referral operated by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. 
	(b)	Goals. This section: (1) replaces prior bans on panhandling, restrictions on aggressive solicitation, and solicitation near automatic teller machines (ATMs) rendered unenforceable by court rulings with a new aggressive solicitation prohibition; (2) establishes new specific prohibitions on solicitation near ATM machines, near residential property, in parking lots, on median strips and near freeway offramps and on the Municipal Railway and the BART system; (3) establishes a requirement that, as appropriate, violators of this ordinance be diverted from the criminal justice system to a screening and assessment program to identify candidates for alcohol and drug dependency treatment and mental health services administered by the Department of Public Health in order to clear their citations. 
	(c)	Definitions. For purposes of this section:

			B.	Continuing to solicit from a person after the person has given a negative response to such soliciting;
			C.	Intentionally touching or causing physical contact with another person without that person's consent in the course of soliciting;

		4.	No person shall solicit in any public transportation vehicle, or in any public or private parking lot or structure.
		5.	Before any law enforcement officer may cite or arrest a person under this ordinance, the officer must warn the person that his or her conduct is in violation of this ordinance and must give the person an opportunity to comply with the provisions of this ordinance.

SEC. 121.  LOITERING OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUBS PROHIBITED.
	(a)	Findings. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco finds that persons who loiter outside a nightclub when an event is in progress imperil the public's safety and welfare. The areas outside nightclubs have become the site of robberies, assaults, and battery. In addition, the Board finds that persons attending nightclubs have become intimidated and fearful for their safety because of the presence of persons loitering outside the clubs. Prohibiting loitering outside nightclubs will assist police and club security staff in protecting club patrons and may decrease the incidence of crimes of violence directed at club patrons by providing law enforcement officers with an additional crime-fighting tool that does not infringe on any person's basic rights. 
	(b)	Prohibition. In the City and County of San Francisco, it shall be unlawful for any person to loiter outside any nightclub between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. when the nightclub is open for business.

		(2)	For the purposes of this ordinance, a nightclub is a Place of Entertainment as defined in Police Code Section 1060.
	(d)	Application. This ordinance is not intended to prohibit any person from engaging in any lawful activity that must be conducted within ten (10) feet from the entrance to a nightclub or ten (10) feet from any point at any lines formed at the entrance to a nightclub such as (1) waiting in line to enter a nightclub, (2) being present in a smoking area designated by the club outside the club for patrons, or (3) waiting for a bus at a bus stop or waiting in line to enter a theater or other business. Lawful activity does not include any activity that can be conducted more than ten (10) feet from the entrance to the nightclub or more than ten (10) feet from any point on any lines formed at the entrance to a nightclub. 
	(e)	Warning. Before any law enforcement officer may cite or arrest a person under this ordinance, the law enforcement officer or personnel working for the nightclub must warn the person that his or her conduct is in violation of this ordinance and must give the person an opportunity to comply with the provisions of this ordinance. 
	(f)	Penalties.
		(1)	First Conviction. Any person violating any provision of this Section shall be guilty of an infraction. Upon conviction, the violator shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50 or more than $100, and/or community service, for each provision violated. 
		(2)	Subsequent Convictions. In any accusatory pleading charging a violation of this Section, if the defendant has been previously convicted of a violation of this Section, each such previous violation and conviction shall be charged in the accusatory pleading. Any person violating any provision of this Section a second time within a thirty (30)-day period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $300 or more than $500, and/or community service, for each provision violated, or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period of not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Any person violating any provision of this Section a third time, and each subsequent time, within a thirty (30) day period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $400 and not more than $500, and/or community service, for each provision violated, or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period of not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
	(g)	Severability. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this Section be for any reason declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or the effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Section or any part thereof.

SEC. 122.  AGGRESSIVE PURSUIT PROHIBITED.
	(a)	It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in aggressive pursuit of another.
	(b)	For purposes of this Section, "aggressive pursuit" shall mean the wilful, malicious or repeated following or harassment of another person, including, but not limited to, wilful or malicious communications by telephone, modem, facsimile or mail with the intent to cause annoyance, intimidation or fear on the part of the person being pursued.

SEC. 124.  FINDINGS.
	The People of the City and County of San Francisco find that persons who loiter or linger at or near automatic public toilets imperil the public's safety and welfare. Some of the automatic public toilets are being used as a place of narcotics sales and use, and for disposal of hypodermic needles. In addition, the People find that persons making legitimate use of automatic public toilets have become intimidated and fearful for their safety because of the presence of persons loitering in or near the toilets and leaving drug paraphernalia in and around the toilets, preventing persons with legitimate need for the toilets from using the toilets. Limiting the number of persons who may use an automatic public toilet at any one time and prohibiting loitering or lingering at or near such toilets may decrease the incidence of these crimes by providing law enforcement officers with an additional crime fighting tool that does not infringe on any person's basic rights. 
	No state law addresses this type of behavior or protects the public from these problems. 
(Added by Ord. 215, File No. 011410, App. 11/2/2001)

	(2)	For the purpose of this ordinance, an automatic public toilet is a single-user toilet located on a public sidewalk or other public property. Automatic public toilets include what are commonly referred to as Decaux toilets.

SEC. 154.  PROHIBITING PUBLIC NUDITY.
	(a)	The Board of Supervisors finds that a person's public exposure of his or her private parts

SEC. 168.  PROMOTION OF CIVIL SIDEWALKS.
	(a)	Findings. San Francisco is a dense, urban environment where everyone must use the public sidewalk for travel. The people of San Francisco find that maintaining pedestrian and authorized commercial activity on public sidewalks is essential to public safety, thriving neighborhoods and a vital economy in the City. The people of the City and County of San Francisco find that sitting or lying down is not the customary use of the public sidewalks. The need to maintain pedestrian and commercial traffic is greatest during the hours of operation of businesses, shops, restaurants, and other City commercial enterprises when public sidewalks are congested, and when City residents are most likely to use their neighborhood sidewalks. Persons who sit or lie down on public sidewalks during business hours threaten the safety of pedestrians, especially the elderly, disabled, vision-impaired, and children. Persons who sit or lie down also deter residents and visitors from patronizing local shops, restaurants and businesses, and deter people from using the sidewalks in their neighborhoods. San Franciscans seek policies that preserve the right to enjoy public space and traverse freely, while protecting the free-speech rights of individuals and groups, as well as other safe activity consistent with City permitting requirements. Business areas and neighborhoods become dangerous to pedestrian safety and economic vitality when individuals block the public sidewalks. This behavior causes a cycle of decline as residents and tourists go elsewhere to walk, meet, shop and dine, and residents become intimidated from using the public sidewalks in their own neighborhoods. Because lying down or sitting is an incompatible use of the sidewalk in residential and commercial areas, and in order to prevent displacement of violators from one district or neighborhood to another, the prohibition applies Citywide. 
		The prohibition against sitting or lying down on sidewalks leaves intact the individual's right to speak, protest or engage in other lawful activity on any sidewalk consistent with any City permitting requirements. 
		The prohibition applies only to public sidewalks. There are a number of places where the restrictions of this ordinance do not apply, including private property, beaches, plazas, public parks, public benches, and other common areas open to the public. The prohibition contains exceptions for medical emergencies, those in wheelchairs, and permitted activities, among others. 
		The people of San Francisco acknowledge that there are myriad reasons why one might sit or lie down on a public sidewalk. The City has offered and offers services to those engaged in sitting or lying down on the sidewalk who appear to be in need, or to those who request service assistance, but the offers are refused in many cases or people continue the conduct despite the provision of services. The City will continue to invest in services for those in need and make efforts to maintain and improve safety on public sidewalks for everyone. In order to provide an opportunity for law enforcement officers to engage people, and to offer to refer to an appropriate entity if the person asks, or if the officer has reason to believe that such a referral would be beneficial, a peace officer may not issue a citation without first warning a person that sitting or lying down is unlawful. 
		Present laws that prohibit the intentional, willful or malicious obstruction of pedestrians do not adequately address the safety hazards, disruption and deterrence to pedestrian traffic caused by persons sitting or lying on sidewalks. 
	(b)	Prohibition. In the City and County of San Francisco, during the hours between seven (7:00) a.m. and eleven (11:00) p.m., it is unlawful to sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, or any object placed upon a public sidewalk. 
	(c)	Exceptions. The prohibitions in Subsection (b) shall not apply to any person: 
		1.	Sitting or lying down on a public sidewalk due to a medical emergency;
		2.	Using a wheelchair, walker, or similar device as the result of a disability;
		3.	Operating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to a sidewalk use permit;
		4.	Participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to and in compliance with a street use or other applicable permit; 
		5.	Sitting on a fixed chair or bench located on the public sidewalk supplied by a public agency or by the abutting private property owner; 
		6.	Sitting in line for goods or services unless the person or person's possessions impede the ability of pedestrians to travel along the length of the sidewalk or enter a doorway or other entrance alongside the sidewalk; 
		7.	Who is a child seated in a stroller; or
		8.	Who is in an area designated as a Pavement to Parks project.
	(d)	Warning. No person shall be cited under this Section unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by this Section after having been notified by a peace officer that the conduct violates this Section. 
	(e)	Other laws and orders. Nothing in any of the exceptions listed in Subsection (c) shall be construed to permit any conduct which is prohibited by Police Code Sections 22-24, which prohibit willfully and substantially obstructing the free passage of any person. 
	(f)	Penalties.
		1.	First Offense. Any person violating any provision of this Section shall be guilty of an infraction. Upon conviction, the violator shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50 or more than $100 and/or community service, for each provision violated. 
		2.	Subsequent Offenses. Any person violating any provision of this Section within 24 hours after violating and being cited for a violation of this Section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $300 and not more than $500, and/or community service, for each provision violated, or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period of not more than ten (10) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Any person violating any provision of this Section within 120 days after the date of conviction of a violation this Section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $400 and not more than $500, and/or community service, for each provision violated, or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period of not more than thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
	(g)	Reporting. One year after the effective date of this ordinance, and every two years thereafter, the Police Department shall make a written report to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors that evaluates the effectiveness of enforcement of this ordinance on the City's neighborhoods. 
	(h)	Outreach. The City shall maintain a neighborhood outreach plan to provide the social services needed by those who chronically sit or lie down on a public sidewalk. The plan will include, but not be limited to, health care and social service capacity, evaluation of service delivery and identification of areas for improved service delivery. 
	(i)	Severability. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this Section be for any reason declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity or the effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Section or any part thereof.

SEC. 366.  DEFINITIONS.
	For the purpose of Sections 366 to 379 inclusive, the following definitions shall apply: 
	(a)	The term "approve," when used in connection with approval of an application for a parade permit by the Chief of Police, means that the Chief of Police has determined that none of the grounds for denying an application, as set forth in Section 369, exists, and that a permit is to be issued once the applicant complies with Section 367, pertaining to applications, and Section 368, pertaining to indemnification. 
	(b)	A "business district" is that area adjacent to a public street in which: (1) 50 percent or more of the property fronting upon one side of the street, for a distance of 600 feet, is occupied by structures in use for commercial purposes; or, (2) 50 percent or more of the property fronting upon both sides of the street, considered together and for a distance of 300 feet, is occupied by structures in use for commercial purposes. A business district may be longer than the distances specified in this section if the above ratio of buildings in use for commercial purposes to the length of the street exists. 
	(c)	"Chief of Police" includes the Special Events Unit or any representative designated by the Chief of Police.
	(d)	To "issue" a permit is to deliver to an applicant for a parade permit written permission to sponsor or hold an event at a specified date and location. 
	(e)	A "parade" is an event, not including an athletic event, in which a group of persons proceed as a collective body for more than one block on any street in the City and County of San Francisco, whether on foot or in any type of vehicle or on an animal or animals, which event obstructs or interferes with the normal flow of vehicular traffic. An "athletic event" is an event in which a group of people collectively engage in a sport or form of physical exercise on any street in the City and County of San Francisco, including but not limited to jogging, bicycling, racewalking, roller skating or running.The following processions are not included in the definitions of a "parade": (1) processions composed wholly of the military or naval forces of the United States or of the State of California; (2) processions incidental to a wedding or funeral; (3) processions composed of one or more governmental officials or candidates accompanied by security personnel to which such officials or candidates are entitled by virtue of their office or candidacy.

(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84; amended by Ord. 394-88, App. 8/26/88)
SEC. 367.  PERMIT REQUIRED; PROCEDURE.
	(a)	Any person desiring to sponsor a parade on any street of the City and County of San Francisco, excluding streets on property under the jurisdiction of the Recreation and Park Commission, shall first obtain a permit therefor from the Chief of Police. 
	(b)	Written application for such permit should be made to the Special Events Unit at least 60 days in advance in order to insure timely appeal of a denial of the application. However, all applications for permits shall be processed by the Chief of Police so long as they are received at least 15 working days in advance of the proposed date of the event; provided, however, that when the proposed event designates a route which passes through a business district, extends over an area which involves more than five intersections (not including alleys), anticipates a number of participants exceeding 250, or requires the Municipal Railway to substantially alter passenger routes or schedules, the applicant shall apply at least 30 days in advance of the proposed date; provided, further, that the Chief of Police may grant a permit to an applicant who applies less than 15 working days in advance if the Chief of Police determines that the permit application requires no substantial investigation or preparation of the route, which determination shall not be subject to administrative review. 
	(c)	The time limitations prescribed above for the filing of a permit application may be waived by the Chief of Police if the applicant can show that the event or events giving rise to the permit application did not reasonably allow the applicant time to file within the time prescribed and imposition of the time limitations would place an unreasonable restriction on the right of free speech. 
	(d)	Application shall be made on a form provided by the Chief of Police and shall include: the name, business and home address, and business and home phone number of the applicant (who shall be a natural person), of the sponsor of the event, and of the event organizer (that is, the person responsible for managing and organizing the details of the parade); the relationship of the applicant to the sponsor; proof of the applicant's authority to act on behalf of the sponsor; a description of the route of the event; the names of all streets to be used; the number of participants anticipated; the starting time and expected finishing time of the event; and any other information requested in order to enable the Chief of Police to verify the information required in this subsection. 
	(e)	Application for a permit shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable permit application fee, in the amount set forth in Section 2.26 of the Police Code. 
	(f)	Applications submitted 60 days or more before the date of the proposed event shall be processed within 30 days. Applications submitted between 30 and 59 days before the date of the proposed event shall be processed within 20 days. Applications submitted between 15 and 29 days before the date of the proposed event shall be processed at least seven days before the date of the proposed event. 
	(g)	Applications submitted less than 15 days before the date of the proposed event shall be processed within a reasonable time, which time shall be given to the applicant at the time the applicant is informed that the time limitations set forth in this Section have been waived. 
	(h)	If an application is not processed within the time specified in Subsection (f), the applicant may obtain approval of a permit application by providing the Chief of Police with two copies of a letter addressed to the Chief of Police, which letter sets forth the details of the proposed event and the date of the application and the fact that the application has not yet been processed. The applicant shall deliver one copy of the letter and have the second copy file-stamped as proof of having complied with this Section. If the Chief of Police does not process the application within 48 hours of delivery by the applicant of the letter described above, the application shall be deemed approved. 
	(i)	The Chief of Police shall issue a permit immediately upon approval of the permit application, and execution and receipt of the indemnification agreement required by Section 368. 
	(j)	The Chief of Police shall, as appropriate, transmit copies of any parade permit issued to the Chief of the Fire Department, the Department of Public Works, Emergency Hospital Service, Department of Public Health, and the General Manager of the Municipal Railway. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84)
SEC. 368.  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT.
	The applicant or sponsor of a parade permit must sign an agreement to reimburse the City and County of San Francisco for any costs incurred by it in repairing damage to City property which results from the actions of those sponsoring the event or authorized participants in the event, and to defend the City against and indemnify and hold the City harmless from any liability to any person which results from the actions of those sponsoring the event or authorized participants in the event. Execution of this agreement must occur at least one calendar week before the date of the proposed event, unless the application is not approved by that time, in which case the Chief of Police shall designate a reasonable time within which it is to be provided. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84)
SEC. 369.  GROUNDS FOR DENIAL OF APPLICATION FOR PARADE PERMIT.
	The Chief of Police shall approve an application for a parade permit unless he or she determines, from a consideration of the application, or such information as the Chief of Police may otherwise obtain, or both, that: 
	(a)	The Chief of Police has reasonable cause to conclude that the applicant or any person or persons participating in the parade will, in connection with that activity, cause physical injury to persons or substantial damage to property; or 
	(b)	The conduct of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route; or 
	(c)	The conduct of the event will require the diversion of so great a number of police officers to properly police the line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection to the rest of the City and County of San Francisco; or 
	(d)	The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the assembly areas of the event will unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such assembly areas; or 
	(e)	The conduct of the event will interfere with the movement of fire-fighting equipment en route to a fire; or
	(f)	The conduct of the event will substantially obstruct or interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the public streets; or 
	(g)	Another permit application has been received, and has been or may be approved, to sponsor a parade at the same time and place requested by the applicant, or so close in time and place that undue confusion or congestion would result, or the Police Department would bear an unreasonable burden in meeting the request for services by more than one applicant; or 
	(h)	The parade will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in four hours or less, or such other reasonable time limit as set by the Chief of Police in light of all relevant circumstances; or 
	(i)	The applicant fails to provide the information requested on the application form or to provide Police Department staff, when requested to do so, with further information in order to enable the Chief of Police to verify the information required on the application form; or 
	(j)	The applicant fails to provide proof of approval from other governmental departments or agencies when such approval is legally required; or 
	(k)	The applicant fails or refuses to comply with any condition reasonably imposed on the granting of the permit in order to insure the safety of event participants, members of the Police Department or the public, or to insure the orderly flow of traffic, or to avoid the likelihood of harm to public or private property, which conditions may include a change in the route of the event; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to authorize the Chief of Police to impose conditions which unreasonably interfere with the right of free speech; or 
	(l)	Other circumstances exist which make it likely that the event would significantly interfere with ordinary activities in the City and County of San Francisco. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84)
SEC. 370.  PROCEDURE FOLLOWING DENIAL OF APPLICATION.
	Upon the denial of any application for a parade permit, the Chief of Police shall inform the applicant of the reason or reasons for the denial in writing. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84)

	The Board of Supervisors shall by motion designate an appropriate committee of the Board to act as a "Committee on Parades" for the purposes of Sections 366 to 379, inclusive, of this Article. 
	The applicant may appeal the denial of an application for a parade permit, or the imposition of conditions on the issuance of a permit, to the Committee on Parades, if such appeal can be timely made. The Committee shall consider such appeal and may either concur in the action of the Chief of Police or overrule such action and order that the permit be approved. If the Committee orders that a permit be approved, it shall have the authority to impose only such conditions as are recommended by the Chief of Police. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84; amended by Ord. 394-88, App. 8/26/88)
SEC. 372.  REVOCATION BY POLICE CHIEF.
	The Chief of Police may revoke a parade permit if an emergency arises which makes it impossible to assign the necessary personnel to the event and still provide the personnel required elsewhere to protect the public, or if information is obtained after the permit is issued from which the Chief of Police reasonably concludes that the permit should not have been approved for reasons set forth in Section 369. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84)
SEC. 373.  VIOLATION OF PERMIT CONDITIONS.
	If a parade deviates from the route approved by the Chief of Police or if participants violate any conditions contained in the permit, the police officer whom the Chief of Police has designated as the officer in charge of overseeing personnel necessary to police the event may, after warning the participants and providing them with an opportunity to return to the approved route or to follow the permit conditions, revoke the permit. 
(Added by Ord. 254-84, App. 5/31/84)
SEC. 374.  UNLAWFUL TO SPONSOR OR PARTICIPATE IN A PARADE WITHOUT A PERMIT OR TO INTERFERE WITH SUCH EVENT.

Such lines may be established either by means of a physical barrier, such as a rope, or by designating a curb or some other line of demarcation as the line beyond which no person or vehicle is to pass. 
	(b)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a), the following persons and vehicles are authorized to cross lines established along a parade route: 
		(i)	Any city, county, state or federal peace or fire prevention officer or vehicle responding to an emergency call; or

SEC. 539.  CURFEW LAW.
	(a)	Findings. The Board of Supervisors finds that a critical need exists for a juvenile curfew ordinance. Minors under the age of 14 possess a particular vulnerability to crime and harmful influence under certain circumstances or when not supervised or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at night; such minors often lack the ability to make critical decisions in an informed and mature manner when exposed to nighttime influences. A curfew ordinance can help to ensure that a minor's parent or legal guardian is able to play an important role in the minor's development and upbringing. Under existing State law, there are limited circumstances under which a police officer can intervene to assist a minor who is in danger or need of assistance. In the absence of a curfew ordinance, an officer does not have a clear guideline as to whether or not he or she can detain a minor to obtain assistance. Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors finds that this juvenile curfew ordinance is necessary. The ordinance is precisely tailored to ensure the welfare of minors and to promote and protect parents' ability to play a role in their children's upbringing. 
	(b)	Definitions. For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions shall apply: 
		(1)	Emancipated Minor. An emancipated minor is a minor who has entered into a valid marriage, is on active duty with any of the armed forces, or has received a declaration of emancipation, as more fully set forth in California Family Code Sections 7000, et seq. 
		(2)	Emergency Mission. An emergency mission is a venture to obtain medical, police, fire, or other assistance that is required by some reasonable necessity to which a minor must attend.

(Added by Ord. 91-94, App. 2/25/94)
SEC. 613.9.5.  FINDINGS.
	1.	"Enhanced-lethality ammunition" means the ammunition that licensees may not sell, lease or otherwise transfer under Police Code Sec. 613.10(g).
	2.	Enhanced-lethality ammunition is designed to tear larger wounds in the body by flattening and increasing in diameter on impact and/or exploding and dispersing shrapnel throughout the body. These design features increase the likelihood that the bullet will hit a major artery or organ, that it will take a more circuitous path through the body to create more widespread damage, and that it will release all of its propulsive force inside the body to cause maximum injury. Accordingly, enhanced-lethality ammunition is more likely to cause severe injury and death than is conventional ammunition that does not flatten or fragment upon impact.
	3.	Enhanced-lethality ammunition has been used in shooting massacres both in San Francisco and abroad. On July 1, 1993, heavily armed gunman Gian Luigi Ferri shot and killed eight people, then himself, in the 101 California Street high-rise in San Francisco using hollow-point bullets. Most recently, on July 24, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik used lethality-enhanced bullets designed to fragment inside the body and cause maximum internal damage to kill and grievously wound dozens of children at a youth camp in Norway.
	4.	Banning the sale of enhanced-lethality ammunition in San Francisco does not substantially burden the right of self defense. The right to use firearms in self defense can be fully exercised using conventional, non-collapsing, non-fragmenting ammunition. Enhanced-lethality ammunition is not in general use, and this unusually injurious ammunition has been banned outside the United States. For example, the Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, has for more than a century prohibited the use in warfare of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.
	5.	Personal firearms kept in the home are more likely to be used against family and friends than intruders. Home firearms may also be used in suicide attempts, accidental shootings and criminal assaults.
	6.	The City and County of San Francisco has a legitimate, important and compelling governmental interest in reducing the likelihood that shooting victims in San Francisco will die of their injuries by reducing the lethality of the ammunition sold and used in the City and County of San Francisco.

	(k)	The licensee shall comply with the requirements of Section 613.10-3 and shall, in addition, post the appropriate notice or notices, as specified below, in a conspicuous location at the entrance of the licensee's premises (or at the entrance to the separate room or, enclosure pursuant to Section 613.10-3(c)).

	(l)	The licensee shall notify the Chief of Police of the name, age and address of, and submit a certificate of eligibility under Penal Code Section 12071 from the State Department of Justice for, any person not listed on the licensee's application under Section 613.2(a)(1) who will be given access to, or control of, workplace firearms, firearm ammunition, or firearm ammunition components.

SEC. 613.10-1.  SALE OR TRANSFER OF 50 CALIBER FIREARMS AND CARTRIDGES RESTRICTED.
	(a)	Findings. The Board of Supervisors finds as follows: 
		(1)	Fifty caliber rifles are military-style firearms, used by armed forces around the world, which combine long range, accuracy and massive power. Fifty caliber rifles are accurate to distances of 1,000 to 2,000 yards (10 to 20 football fields), depending on the skill of the shooter, and can penetrate armored vehicles, disable aircraft and damage industrial targets, such as refineries and hazardous chemical plants. The dangers of these weapons are detailed in "Voting from the Rooftops: How the Gun Industry Armed Osama bin Laden, other Foreign and Domestic Terrorists, and Common Criminals with 50 Caliber Sniper Rifles," Violence Policy Center (2001). 
		(2)	Fifty caliber rifles and ammunition are proliferating on the civilian market in the United States.
		(3)	In a briefing paper dated August 4, 1999, the United States General Accounting Office concluded that 50 caliber rifles have been associated with significant criminal activity, stating "Our investigation revealed that 50 caliber semiautomatic rifles have been linked to domestic and international criminal activity. We have established a nexus to terrorist groups, outlaw motorcycle gangs, international drug cartels, domestic drug dealers, religious cults, militia groups, potential assassins, and violent criminals." 
		(4)	California Penal Code Sections 12303.6 and 12304 currently prohibit the sale of destructive devices, defined to include weapons of a caliber greater than 60 caliber and any ammunition therefor. In addition, recognizing the danger posed by 50 caliber rifles, the Legislature recently passed, and the Governor has signed, legislation restricting the sale and transfer and tracking the ownership of, 50 caliber rifles; 
		(5)	The City and County of San Francisco has a high concentration of potential targets for terrorist attacks;
		(6)	The firearms industry has recently introduced a 50 caliber handgun, and reports indicate that it is difficult to control and fires with five times the muzzle power of a .357 magnum handgun; 
		(7)	A recent analysis of data published by the manufacturer of this 50 caliber handgun and ballistics test data published in American Rifleman magazine indicate that bullets fired from the handgun may be capable of penetrating Type IIIA body armor, the highest grade of concealable body armor normally worn by law enforcement officers in the field. The dangers of these weapons are detailed in "Vest Buster: The .500 Smith & Wesson Magnum-The Gun Industry's Latest Challenge to Law Enforcement Body Armor," Violence Policy Center (2004); 
		(8)	Fifty caliber firearms have no legitimate hunting or sporting purpose in the City and County of San Francisco. Further, such firearms are ill-suited for use as a means to defend one's home or property, since they are difficult to control, greatly increase the risk of harm to bystanders, and the firepower greatly exceeds that which is necessary to protect property or homeowners; 
		(9)	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that the uncontrolled proliferation and use of 50 caliber firearms and ammunition poses an unacceptable threat to the health, safety and security of the public. 
	(b)	Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this Section is to protect the health, safety, security and general welfare of the citizens of the City and County of San Francisco and the City's law enforcement personnel by reducing the risk of personal injury, death or property damage caused by 50 caliber firearms. Specifically with respect to regulating 50 caliber handguns, it is the purpose and intent of this Section to protect of the citizens of the City and County of San Francisco and the City's law enforcement personnel by reducing the risk of personal injury, death or property damage caused by persons using 50 caliber handguns. It is not the intent of this Section to address the problem of handgun safety, as addressed, for example in Sections 12125 through 12133 of the California Penal Code, or to otherwise regulate 50 caliber handguns based on consumer product safety considerations for the person using the handgun. 
	(c)	Definitions.

The term "50 caliber cartridge" does not include any memorabilia or display item that is filled with a permanent inert substance or that is otherwise permanently altered in a manner that prevents ready modification for use as live ammunition. 
		(3)	As used in this section, the term "rifle" shall mean any firearm that is designed or redesigned, made or remade, and intended to be fired from the shoulder, and which is designed or redesigned, made or remade to use the energy in a fixed cartridge to fire only a single projectile through a rifled bore for each single pull of the trigger. The term "rifle" shall not include any shotgun.

		(1)	A number of other states have enacted legislation to facilitate the issuance of licenses to carry concealed firearms with the result that firearms manufacturers have been designing and marketing ultracompact handguns to respond to the development of the market created by the relaxation of concealed weapons laws in these states. 
		(2)	These ultracompact handguns are designed to allow the complete concealment of the weapon on the person.
		(3)	In contrast to those states that have relaxed requirements for issuance of licenses to carry concealed weapons, California has not done so. Moreover, in San Francisco, permits to carry concealed weapons are issued only in very limited circumstances. There are currently fewer than ten individuals authorized by the City to carry concealed weapons. 
		(4)	Because concealed weapons permits are rarely issued in San Francisco, any legitimate market for concealable ultracompact handguns is exceedingly small. 
		(5)	Ultracompact handguns have no legitimate hunting or sporting purpose, and are ill-suited for use as a means to defend one's home or property, since the short barrel length makes them inherently inaccurate. 
		(6)	A national study of weapons confiscated by law enforcement agencies found that a substantial majority of the handguns confiscated have a barrel length of less than three inches. 
		(7)	A survey of incarcerated felons found that easy concealment is very often an important consideration in the selection of handguns that are later used to commit crimes. 
		(8)	A study of persons in California found that persons whose applications for the purchase of a handgun were denied based on prior criminal activity were more likely to attempt to purchase small, highly concealable handguns than are potential purchasers whose applications were not denied. 
		(9)	A study of handgun owners in one state found that 67 percent of felons but just 30 percent of other handgun owners reported owning a handgun with a barrel length of three inches or less. 
		(10)	Because there is evidence that criminals prefer smaller, more concealable handguns, and since handguns are used in at least 80 percent of all violent crimes involving firearms in the United States, the public interest is not served by allowing the unregulated sale of easily concealable ultracompact handguns. The concealability of these weapons makes them a high public security and safety risk when owned and carried by individuals unlicensed to carry concealed weapons, particularly in a high-density urban area such as San Francisco. 
		(11)	The dangers of ultracompact firearms are further detailed in "Pocket Rockets-The Gun Industry's Sale of Increased Killing Power," Violence Policy Center (2001). 
	(b)	Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this Section is to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and County of San Francisco by reducing the potential for death or injury to citizens and law enforcement personnel attributable to ultracompact firearms. It is not the intent of this Section to address the problem of handgun safety, as addressed, for example, in Sections 12125 through 12133 of the California Penal Code, or to otherwise regulate ultracompact firearms based on consumer product safety considerations for the person using the firearm. 
	(c)	Sale of Ultracompact Firearms Restricted. No person licensed pursuant to this Article shall sell, lease or otherwise transfer any ultracompact firearm except as authorized by paragraph (d) of this Section. Nothing in this section shall preclude any person licensed pursuant to this Article from processing firearms transactions between unlicensed parties pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 12072 of the Penal Code of the State of California. 
	(d)	Exceptions. The requirements of this Section shall not apply to the sale, lease or other transfer of an ultracompact firearm in the following circumstances:

		(3)	To any state or local correctional facility;
		(4)	To a federal law enforcement officer, provided such law enforcement officer is authorized to acquire an ultracompact firearm and does so while acting within the course and scope of his or her employment; 
		(5)	To a private security company licensed to do business in the State of California;
		(6)	To a person described in Sections 12302 or 12322(a) of the California Penal Code, provided such person is authorized to acquire an ultracompact firearm and does so while acting within the course and scope of his or her employment; 
		(7)	To any person who is properly identified as a full-time paid peace officer, as defined in Sections 830.1, 830.2, 830.4, or 830.5 of the California Penal Code, provided such peace officer is authorized to acquire an ultracompact firearm and does so while acting within the course and scope of his or her employment. 
		(8)	To the sale, lease or other transfer of any antique firearm., as defined in paragraph (16) of subsection (a) of Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code. 
		(9)	To the loan of an ultracompact firearm to a person for use solely as a prop in a motion picture, television, or video, theatrical or other entertainment production or event, provided that such person is in compliance with Section 12081 of the California Penal Code; 
		(10)	To any person or entity conducting a transaction that is exempt from the provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 12072 of the California Penal Code; 
		(11)	To any person or entity conducting a transaction described in subdivision (k) of Section 12078 of the California Penal Code;
		(12)	To a firearms dealer who has been issued a Federal Firearms License, and who is in compliance with the requirements of Section 12071 of the California Penal Code; 
		(13)	To any person or entity acquiring an ultracompact firearm by bequest, intestate succession or otherwise by operation of law;
		(14)	To a non-profit entity that is authorized to destroy firearms, and which has agreed to destroy the firearm being transferred
		(15)	To a federal, state, or local historical society, museum, or institutional collection that is open to the public, provided that the ultracompact firearm is used for display purposes, is unloaded, and is secured from unauthorized use; 
		(16)	To the delivery of an ultracompact firearm to a licensed gunsmith, as defined in California Penal Code Section 12001(r), or to a person licensed pursuant to California Penal Code Section 12071, for purposes of service or repair, or to the return of the firearm to its owner by the gunsmith or by licensee following the completion of service or repairs; 
		(17)	To the return of an ultracompact firearm to its owner by a person licensed pursuant to this Article where the firearm was initially delivered to the licensee for the purpose of a consignment sale or as collateral for a pawnbroker loan. 
	(e)	Penalties.
		(1)	Violation of this section shall be punishable as a misdemeanor. In addition, each violation of this Section shall constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of the licensee's firearms dealer license under this Article. 
		(2)	Each transaction in violation of this Section shall be deemed a distinct and separate violation.

SEC. 617.  PROHIBITION AGAINST POSSESSION OR SALE OF FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION ON PROPERTY CONTROLLED BY THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
	A.	Legislative Findings.
		(1)	The national and statewide statistical information available from numerous sources overwhelmingly demonstrates that the incidence of gunshot fatalities and injuries has reached alarming and thus, unacceptable proportions; and 
		(2)	Government at all levels has a substantial interest in protecting the people from those who acquire guns illegally and use them to commit crimes resulting in injury or death of their victims; and 
		(3)	Recent events throughout the City and County have generated additional fears of random usage of guns to commit violence on unsuspecting residents, children and adults alike; and 
		(4)	The Board of Supervisors finds that crimes and injuries committed with the use of a firearm are prevalent in San Francisco, with local statistics showing an increase in homicides by use of a gun increasing from 39 gun homicides out of 63 total homicides in 2001, which is a 63 percent increase, to 68 gun homicides out of 85 total homicides in 2006, which is an 80 percent increase. Local statistics also show that San Francisco Police Department has seized 1,158 guns in 2005, and 1,104 guns in 2006. In 2007, there have already been 25 gun homicides. 
		(5)	In the City and County of San Francisco, the number of nonfatal injuries from guns has steadily increased. While, in 2001, 81 patients were admitted to SF General Trauma Center for serious injuries resulting from gun shots, the number of patients admitted for serious injuries rose to 228 by 2006. Similarly, the total number of shootings that resulted in nonfatal injuries documented by SFPD was 269 in 2005, 303 in 2006, and in 2007 this number has already reached 105 by May 10; and 
		(6)	Gun crimes in and around schools and on buses carrying students to and from school have become increasingly common; and
		(7)	In 2003 and 2004, 52 percent of the City's gun violence victims were under the age of 25.
		(8)	Homicides committed with handguns are the leading cause of firearms related injuries and death in California; and
		(9)	The widespread availability of illegally obtained firearms has resulted in a significant rise in the number of shooting incidents across the County; and 
		(10)	The Board of Supervisors has authority over the management and control of City and County property, and it may regulate, by ordinance, the manner in which the property of the City and County is accessed and used by members of the public; and 
		(11)	Prohibiting the possession or sale of firearms and/or ammunition on City and County property will promote the public health and safety by contributing to the reduction in the presence of firearms and the potential for gunshot fatalities and injuries in the county. It will increase the confidence of members of the public that they are not at risk of injury from firearms when they seek to use the property and facilities of the City and County. In particular, this Board of Supervisors finds that an enormous number of the general public utilizes the parks, playgrounds and squares of San Francisco. This Board finds that prohibiting the possession or sale of firearms and ammunition on City and County property will help to ensure the safety of the general public and specifically children who are among the most vulnerable in our society; and 
		(12)	The California Supreme Court has ruled that State Law does not preempt local laws banning the possession and sale of firearms and ammunition on their property. In Nordyke v.

County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 853, the Supreme Court upheld a Los Angeles County Ordinance prohibiting all sales of firearms and ammunition on county property. These rulings uphold the legal ability of the Board of Supervisors to ban the possession and sale of firearms and ammunition on City and County property.

	(a)	Findings.
		(1)	The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco finds that the unauthorized removal of newspapers before they reach their intended reading public, including the unauthorized removal of newspapers circulated to the public free of charge, injures the people of the City and County by depriving them of informative printed news, entertainment, and public notices.

PROHIBITING OF PROFESSIONAL STRIKEBREAKERS
Sec. 650.Findings.Sec. 651.Definitions.Sec. 652.Unlawful Conduct.Sec. 653.Violation.Sec. 654.Severability.
SEC. 650.  FINDINGS.
	Relations between organized labor and management in this City and County have for many years been marked by a mature adherence to the principles of good faith, collective bargaining and a mutual respect for the rights, interests and well being of working people, business and industry. The importation or use in this City and County of professional strikebreakers as replacements during a strike or lockout endangers such sound and beneficial relations between labor and management. 
	Experience in this City and County and in other parts of this country demonstrates that the utilization of professional strikebreakers in labor disputes is inimical to the public welfare and good order in that such practices tend to prolong industrial strife, frustrate collective bargaining and encourage violence, crimes and other disorders. 
	Persons who customarily offer themselves as replacements during labor disputes are generally of unsavory character and accustomed to association with undesirable elements. The introduction of such persons into the community and their employment in this City and County is harmful to our citizens and threatens the public peace. 
	The aforementioned evils are beyond the regulation of applicable state or federal law, and the mitigation and correction thereof requires the exercise of the police power of this City and County.

SEC. 660.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
	(a)	The primary purpose of the public streets and sidewalks is for use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic; however, state and federal courts have determined that sidewalks are also traditional public for a for the exchange of ideas and views protected by our Federal and State Constitutions. 
	(b)	The sale of goods, products and services with its corresponding inquiry regarding the quality and price of goods, bargaining over that price, and exchange of goods, products and services for consideration, by its nature has created greater problems with regard to the use of the public sidewalk than the traditional solicitation of contributions by charitable organizations. In particular, the unregulated sale of goods, products and services on the public sidewalks by charitable organizations and persons soliciting by sales on behalf of charitable organizations has caused congestion and potential use of force that threatens the safety of pedestrians attempting to use the sidewalks and public transit for their primary purpose. It has also interfered with pedestrian access to private residences, Municipal Railway, cable car and bus zones, and places of business. One of the primary causes of these problems is the sales activities on the public sidewalks of commercial enterprises who represent that part of their profits will go to a charitable organization. 
	(c)	Reasonable regulation of sidewalk sales activities is necessary to protect the public safety, health, welfare, as well as the substantial esthetic interest in preserving the beauty, solitude and viewing areas of certain parts of the City. The sales activities of charitable organizations pose esthetic problems different from and greater than those presented by street artists and other sidewalk peddlers. Street artists sell goods of their own making. Thus, street artists offer a variety of goods, and the volume of their merchandise is limited. On the other hand, almost without exception, those selling on behalf of charitable organizations peddle t-shirts and sweatshirts. The presence on the sidewalk of tables piled high with sweatshirts and t-shirts is much more visually offensive than the sale of jewelry and other items sold by street artists and other sidewalk vendors. Indeed, the sales activities of charitable organizations have had the effect of converting many areas of the City into permanent flea markets. 
	(d)	The City repeatedly has sought to address the problems created by the sales activities of charitable solicitors by means less restrictive than those set out in this legislation, including restrictions on where charitable sales activities may take place and the type of information that charitable organizations must disclose. These less restrictive measures have failed to alleviate adequately the problems caused by the sales activities of charitable organizations. In particular, the current locational regulations, such as the amount of sidewalk space that must be left for pedestrian passage, the sales of merchandise adjacent to unloading and bus zones, and the space between persons engaged in charitable sales, have proved ineffective to adequately protect public health and safety. These locational restrictions were initially intended to apply to the sale of books, pamphlets and other purely communicative items. Experience has taught that the safety problems created by the sales of sweatshirts and other commercial merchandise by charitable organizations are greater than those caused by other sidewalk vending or that would be caused by the sales of purely communicative items. Sidewalk sweatshirt vending by charitable organizations consistently draws larger crowds of prospective buyers than does sidewalk sales by street artists and other peddlers. Therefore, the safety concerns associated with charitable sales are different from those posed by other vendors. Accordingly, different regulations are needed. In particular, sales activities on the building side of sidewalks, with their attendant crowds, frequently force pedestrians to walk in the street, which endangers those pedestrians. 
	(e)	The San Francisco Street Artists Program, established by a mandate of the people of the City and County of San Francisco with the adoption of Proposition L on November 4, 1975, is an essential component of this City's effort to support the work of its resident artisans. Permitting the sale of merchandise in spaces designated as Street Artists spaces by persons other than Street Artists tends to confuse the public regarding the nature of the products sold and adversely affects the credibility of the Street Artists Program. 
	(f)	The City and County of San Francisco has a duty to safeguard its citizens from fraudulent solicitors. Like other communities, San Francisco has traditionally been plagued with persons defrauding its citizens by falsely representing that they are soliciting contributions for charitable purposes. The most effective method for protecting citizens from fraudulent solicitors is to require full disclosure to the public of information regarding the operations and purposes of persons soliciting for charitable purposes and to ensure that the information disclosed is truthful. 
	(g)	The City also has a duty to preserve the visual quality of its sidewalks, parks and plazas, prevent the obstruction of public viewing areas, and preserve the tranquility and special ambience of areas that have been created to provide members of the public with zones of peace, quiet and solitude. There are areas of the City, such as Twin Peaks and portions of the Fisherman's Wharf area and parks, where the Board finds that sales activities, whether conducted by charitable organizations or for-profit entities, are inconsistent with these esthetic qualities as well as public safety. The Board also finds that because of the unique nature of City parks, the regulation of sales activities in parks is better left to the Recreation and Parks Commission. 
	(h)	In adopting these amendments, the Board of Supervisors is aware that a federal appellate court has enjoined the enforcement of Section 660.2(j) of this Article with respect to the sale of items that are inextricably intertwined with a political, ideological, religious or philosophical message. The Board is also aware that the City is pursuing a further appeal of this ruling. The amendments to this Article are in no way intended as a substitute for the City's appeal. Rather, these amendments are intended to reduce somewhat the problems caused by the sales activities of charitable organizations, pending a resolution of the City's appeal.

However, if three notices requiring the correction of any violation of this Section (whether the violation involves the same or different displays) are served on any person within a 30-day period, the City Attorney may pursue the remedies set forth in this Section against that person without the serving of another notice, if the additional violation occurs within 90 days of the serving of the third notice. 
		(5)	Violation of this Section shall constitute grounds for injunctive relief. In addition, any person who violates or refuses to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be liable for a civil penalty of $100 a day for each violation, which penalty shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the People of the City and County of San Francisco in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each separate display of tobacco advertising or promotion prohibited by this Section shall be considered a separate violation. Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate violation. In those instances in which a notice of correction is required by this Section, there shall be no penalty assessed for displays that occur during the period of time allowed for correction. Any penalty assessed and recovered in an action brought pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco.

	(h)	Disclaimers. By prohibiting the advertising or promotion of tobacco products in outdoor or publicly visible locations, the City and County of San Francisco is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its officers and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach proximately caused injury. 
	(i)	Severability. If any provision of this Section or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, this Section, to the extent it can be given effect, or the application of this Section to persons other than the person to whom it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and to this end, the provisions of this Section are severable.

SEC. 680.  ADVERTISING VEHICLES PROHIBITED ON CITY STREETS.
	(a)	Findings and Purpose. The inherent primary purpose of commercial advertising vehicles is to display commercial advertising on public streets. By their nature, commercial advertising vehicles are intended to distract, and aim to capture and hold the attention of, members of the public on or adjoining public streets, including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and others. Moreover, such vehicles display commercial advertising from a mobile platform, including while the vehicle is moving within the flow of traffic, potentially stopping, starting, or turning abruptly, accentuating the inherent tendency of such advertising to seize attention and to distract. Additionally, the use of motor vehicles to display commercial advertising creates exhaust emissions. For these reasons, the Board of Supervisors finds that commercial advertising vehicles create aesthetic blight and visual clutter and create potential and actual traffic and health and safety hazards. The purposes of this section are (1) to promote the public health, safety and welfare of motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, and others using the City's public streets and roadways and adjoining areas, by eliminating the aesthetic blight and visual clutter and traffic and safety hazards caused by the operation of commercial advertising vehicles on the City's streets; (2) to reduce congestion on the City's streets; (3) to reduce exhaust emissions, by eliminating as an emissions source a type of commercial advertising display whose use may require continuous or extensive operation of motor vehicle engines; (4) to protect public investment in and the character and dignity of the City's streets; and (5) to aid in the attraction of tourists and other visitors who are so important to the economy of the City. This section is not intended to regulate any non-commercial speech, including non-commercial advertising or signage. 
	(b)	Prohibition. No person may operate any commercial advertising vehicle in or on any public street in the City and County of San Francisco. 
	(c)	Definitions. As used in this Section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
		(1)	"City" means the City and County of San Francisco.
		(2)	"Commercial advertising vehicle" means a motor vehicle that is carrying, towing, or otherwise displaying any commercial advertising sign, unless the vehicle is used primarily to transport passengers or goods. 
		(3)	"Commercial advertising sign" means a banner, placard, poster, card, picture, sign or display that does no more than propose a commercial transaction. 
	(d)	Enforcement.
		(1)	The Police Department shall issue a written notice of violation concerning, and requiring the immediate correction of, any violation of this Section to the driver of any commercial advertising vehicle that is being driven or used in violation of this Section, as well as to the owner or other person responsible for the vehicle, if the identity of that owner or other person is known or readily ascertainable. If issued to the driver of a commercial advertising vehicle, the notice shall require the driver to inform the owner or other person responsible for the operation of the commercial advertising vehicle of the notice and of the violation to which it relates. Notice to the driver of a commercial advertising vehicle under this subsection shall be deemed notice to the owner or other person responsible for the operation of the vehicle. 
		(2)	The City Attorney is authorized to enforce this Section by appropriate civil action. No such action shall be commenced against any person unless and until the Police Department has issued a notice of violation requiring correction to that person, as specified above, and that person has failed to comply with this Section and with that notice. In any civil action brought to enforce this Section, the City Attorney may pursue the remedies set forth in this Section for the violation of this Section that is subject of the notice, as well as for any subsequent violations of this Section that have occurred within one year after the issuance of the notice without regard to whether the Police Department issued subsequent notices concerning those subsequent violations. 
		(3)	Violation of this Section shall constitute grounds for injunctive relief. In addition, any person who violates or refuses to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be liable for a civil penalty which shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the People of the City and County of San Francisco in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each separate display of commercial advertising prohibited by this Section, and each day that a violation of this Section is committed or permitted to continue, shall constitute a separate violation. The amount of such civil penalty shall be $250 for the first violation, $350 for the second violation, and $500 for each subsequent violation of this Section. Any penalty assessed and recovered in an action brought pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco. The person against whom a penalty is assessed, or against whom an injunction is obtained, also shall be liable for the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the City and County of San Francisco in bringing any civil action to enforce the provisions of this Section. 
		(4)	Violation of this Section shall not constitute a criminal offense.
		(5)	In any action brought to enforce this Section, the City Attorney may also seek any remedies available under state or federal law.

			(ii)	Upon the applicant's request, the Entertainment Commission shall continue the hearing for an additional period of time to allow the applicant an opportunity to comply with the requirements of this Article, in which case the time period is extended for that additional period; and 
			(iii)	If the applicant fails to post or maintain notice of the hearing, or make a good faith effort to distribute leaflets to residences, as required by Subsection (b) of this Section, the Director shall have the hearing before the Entertainment Commission continued for such period or periods of time that the Director determines necessary for the applicant to comply with the posting requirement, in which case the time period is extended for that additional period or periods of time; and 
			(iv)	If the Director finds that the Commission is unable to meet during the 45 day time period or any permitted time extension due to exigent circumstances, the time period shall be extended until the Commission is able to meet; the Commission shall consider the matter at the first meeting that it conducts following such circumstances. 
	(e)	(1) 	If the permit applicant has not obtained all permits required for the Business from other City departments by the date of the hearing on the application, the Entertainment Commission may grant a conditional permit pending the issuance of the other required City permits; provided, however, the Commission shall take this action only if sufficient information has been provided to allow for adequate evaluation of the application and if grounds for denial, as set forth in Subsection (f), are not present. Any permit conditionally granted by the Entertainment Commission under this Subsection(e)(1) may be appealed to the Board of Appeals. Any such appeal shall be filed within 10 days of the decision of the Entertainment Commission's conditionally granting the permit. No Person may operate a Business for which a permit has been conditionally granted unless and until the Person has obtained all permits and authorizations required from other City departments. 
		(2)	If the Entertainment Commission does not grant, conditionally grant or deny the permit for a Place of Entertainment within the time required by Subsection (d)(1) of this Section, including any extensions of time provided for in Subsection (d)(1), the permit sought by the applicant shall be deemed granted, conditioned on the requirements that the Permittee obtain all required permits from other City departments within nine months and comply with all the requirements of this Article. The time by which the Entertainment Commission must act commences on the date that the applicant has filed a completed application under Section 1060.5(a). 
	(f)	The Entertainment Commission shall grant or conditionally grant a permit for a Place of Entertainment pursuant to this Article unless it finds that:

		(4)	The permit applicant has not provided a Security Plan that adequately addresses the safety of persons and property and provides for the orderly dispersal of individuals and traffic. 
		(5)	If there is an unresolved citation applicable to the premises that has been issued by a City department, the Entertainment Commission shall not grant the permit without documented authorization from the department that issued the citation. 
		(6)	If the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, in person at the Entertainment Commission hearing on the permit application or in writing prior to the hearing, objects to the granting of the permit on the basis that the Commission should make one or more of the findings stated in Subsections (f)(1)-(4) above, the Commission may not issue the permit without specifically addressing the objection in writing or on the record, at a Commission meeting, and explaining specifically why the objection does not warrant the finding. This explanation requirement applies but is not limited to objections raised by the Chief or Chief's designee to the adequacy of a proposed security plan. For purposes of this Subsection (f)(6), the Captain for the district where the Place of Entertainment would be located, or the Captain's designee, is deemed the Chief's designee unless the Chief of Police directs otherwise. 
		(7)	The explanation requirement stated in Subsection (f)(6) above also applies to objections raised by other City departments; provided, however, that this Subsection (f)(7) does not diminish the power of other City departments to issue permits or other authorization required for a Business to operate, and does not empower the Entertainment Commission to override a decision by another City department regarding the issuance of a permit or other authorization required for a Business to operate.

	(d)	DIRECTOR MAY VACATE ORDER.

	(e)	POLICE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDATION OF SUSPENSION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. The Chief of Police, or the Chief's designee, may recommend to the Director, orally or in writing, that the Director suspend a permit for public safety in accordance with the grounds for suspension stated in Subsection (a) above.

SEC. 1060.20.4.  REVOCATION OF A PERMIT.
	(a)	Grounds for Revocation. The Entertainment Commission may revoke any permit issued under this Article if it determines after a public hearing that any of the following conditions exist: 
		(1)	The Permittee has knowingly made any false, misleading, or fraudulent statement of material fact or has knowingly omitted a material fact in the application for a permit. 
		(2)	The Permittee has failed to pay any fee or charge required under this Article.
		(3)	The Permittee has failed to surrender the permit as required by Section 1060.24(b).
		(4)	One or more of the grounds for suspension enumerated in Section 1060.20.1(a) applies, and considerations of public safety warrant revocation of the permit. For purposes of this provision, "considerations of public safety" means a substantial risk of physical harm or injury to individuals. In determining whether considerations of public safety warrant revocation, the Commission shall evaluate the likelihood and seriousness of the threat to public safety that continued operation of the Business under the permit presents. In making its determination, the Commission shall consider the following factors: (i) the history of violence and other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business; (ii) a pattern of the Permittee's noncompliance with Security Plan requirements imposed by law or as a condition of the permit; (iii) the frequency of the Permittee's violations of other provisions of law or permit conditions, which violations have contributed to violence or other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business; (iv) the degree to which the Permittee's action or inaction has been responsible for violence and other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business; and (v) the degree to which the City, through the Entertainment Commission, Director, Police Department, or otherwise, has notified the Permittee of violence or other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business and/or of the need to take action to reduce such problems, and the promptness and efficacy of the Permittee's responses. 
		(5)	One or more of the grounds for suspension enumerated in Section 1060.20.1(a) applies, and revocation is warranted because the problems that those grounds have created have been serious and continuing, and the action or inaction of the Permittee contributing to those problems has been persistent; provided, that the circumstances warranting revocation under this provision would constitute a public nuisance within the meaning of Section 3480 of the California Civil Code. 
	(b)	Hearing by Commission. The Entertainment Commission shall give the Permittee and the Manager written notice of a hearing to determine whether to revoke a permit. The notice shall set forth the grounds for the proposed revocation and the date, time and location of the hearing. 
	(c)	Application for Permit After Revocation. The revocation of a permit under this Article shall not preclude the Permittee from applying for a new permit under this Article, except that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, including but not limited to Sections 1060.5(f) and 1060.5.1(f), revocation under Section 1060.20.4(a)(4) or Section 1060.20.4(a)(5) shall render the Permittee ineligible to apply for a new permit under this Article for one year from the date of revocation. 
	(d)	When considering whether to revoke a permit under this Article, the Commission and the Director shall consider any previous denial of a permit application or previous suspension or revocation of a permit, under this Article or Article 15.2, for the same permit applicant or Permittee when the circumstances warranting the previous action are relevant to the current determination.

	(f)	If the Director determines that disapproval of the application may be warranted under Section 1060.5(f) or 1060.5.1(f), the Director shall schedule a hearing on the matter for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Entertainment Commission.

SEC. 1060.29.  ONE TIME EVENT PERMIT.
	(a)	This Section provides a procedure for permitting a Person to conduct, maintain, promote or sponsor Entertainment on the premises specified in the One Time Event Permit for a limited number of one-day occurrences in a 12-month period, including operation between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. No Person shall conduct, maintain, promote or sponsor Entertainment between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. without a One Time Event Permit or an Extended-Hours Premises Permit. One Time Event Permits may be issued for a premises for which a Place of Entertainment Permit has been issued, but for which no Extended-Hours Premises Permit has been issued, when the applicant proposes operating between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Nevertheless, the One Time Event Permit is not intended to function as a routine substitute for a Person's securing either the Place of Entertainment Permit or the Extended-Hours Permit when the Person's course of conduct indicates that either or both of those permits would be more appropriate to seek. For purposes of One Time Event Permits, the word "premises" means the area or structure where the event for which a permit is sought occurs. 
	(b)	Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Director may issue One Time Event Permits and applicants may appeal the Director's denial of an application to the Entertainment Commission. 
	(c)	Each One Time Event Permit shall issue for no longer than one 24-hour period. One Time Event Permits may not be issued for the same premises for consecutive 24-hour periods without a six-hour break between the end time for the first permit and the start time for the second permit. If a One Time Event Permit includes permission to operate between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m., another One Time Event Permit for the same premises later that calendar day may not authorize commencement of operations before 12:00 noon. 
	(d)	There shall be no limit on the number of One Time Event Permits a Person may obtain, provided that no more than one permit per month is issued for the same premises. Notwithstanding this restriction. One Time Event Permits may be issued for events that will occur on consecutive days on the same premises or on non-consecutive days within a ten-day period on the same premises, but shall not issue permits allowing events to occur for more than 12 days on the same premises within any twelve-month period. 
	(e)	A Person may obtain more than one One Time Event Permit for the same day. In such an instance, in considering whether to grant the permit(s) and/or place conditions on the permit(s), the Director or Entertainment Commission as appropriate under the procedures of this Section, shall give heightened scrutiny to each permit application to ensure that the legal standards for granting the permit(s) are met and to determine what conditions, if any, may be appropriate to place on the permit(s). In addition, if the applicant submits an application for more than one One Time Event Permits for the same day less than 40 days prior to the day of the event, the Director or Entertainment Commission may disapprove the application(s) on the ground that the applicant filed too late to provide adequate time to evaluate the application(s) so as to determine whether the permit(s) should be granted and/or whether conditions should be placed on the permit(s). 
	(f)	The One Time Event Permit shall be subject to reasonable time, place, and manner conditions, including but not limited to conditions on amplified sound, in-and-out privileges, admission of minors, and lighting of the premises. 
	(g)	Every Person seeking a permit pursuant to this Section shall file an application with the Director no less than seven days before the proposed event and shall pay the filing fee provided in Section 2.26 of this Code. The applicant shall submit a proposed Security Plan and any other information required for applications under Section 1060.5 as the Director may require. For events taking place in an outdoor area or in both a structure and an outdoor area, the Security Plan shall include additional security personnel to provide adequate security, as determined by the Director, in consultation with the San Francisco Police Department, given the size and nature of the outdoor space. The Director shall send the application no later than seven days before the date of the proposed event to those City departments with jurisdiction over the matter, including, as appropriate, the San Francisco Police Department, Fire Department, Department of Building Inspection, and Department of Public Health. These departments shall complete all necessary inspections and report their determinations to the Director within three City business days of receiving the application. In addition, the Director shall send all applications to the San Francisco Police Department for such input from the Police Department as it deems appropriate. 
	(h)	An applicant for a One Time Event Permit who files an application at least 40 days before the date of the proposed event shall have the right to appeal the Director's denial of the application to the Entertainment Commission. The Director shall act on applications filed at least 40 days before the event within a time period that allows for an appeal to the Commission. Applicants who do not file at least 40 days before the proposed event shall have no right to appeal a denial of the application to the Entertainment Commission unless the Commission has sufficient time to schedule and provide notice of the hearing on the matter for a regularly scheduled meeting. When an applicant files an application less than 40 days before the proposed event, the Director shall inform the applicant that there may be insufficient time for the applicant to appeal the Director's denial to the Commission. 
	(i)	The Director shall review applications for a One Time Event Permit according to the standards set forth in Section 1060.5(f) and shall grant a permit unless the Director finds that the application was filed less than seven days before the proposed event, denial is warranted under any of the grounds set forth in Section 1060.5(f), or another application has been submitted and a permit issued for the same premises during the same time period. The Director shall decide whether to grant or deny a complete application promptly after the date by which other City departments are required to report on the proposed application under Subsection (e). If another application has been submitted for the same time and place and is still pending, the Director shall deny the application unless the applicant requests that it remain open until the Director has determined whether to grant or deny any earlier-filed application. When multiple applicants submit complete applications for the same time and place, the Director shall make determinations on them in the order in which they were received. 
	(j)	If the permit is denied, the Director shall state in writing the reason for the denial and shall notify the applicant of the determination electronically and either by mail or personal delivery. The Director shall have the discretion to submit any application to the Entertainment Commission for its determination whether to grant or deny a One Time Event Permit under the provisions of this Section. 
	(k)	The applicant may appeal the Director's decision to the Entertainment Commission by filing a written request for review within five City business days of the Director's decision. The Commission shall hear and decide the appeal as expeditiously as possible, but in no event later than 21 days after the date that the applicant filed the appeal. If the applicant has filed the application less than 40 days before the proposed event and the Commission does not have sufficient time to provide the required public notice of the appeal for a regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission is not required to consider the matter. 
	(l)	When granting a permit, the Director or Entertainment Commission as appropriate under the procedures of this Section, shall require the applicant as a condition of the permit to comply with the approved Security Plan. Notwithstanding the definition of Security Plan in Section 1060(n), the Security Plan for a One Time Event Permit shall provide at least one Security Guard for every 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit. If after approving a Security Plan, the Director receives additional information that reasonably demonstrates that the Security Plan is inadequate, the Director may require the Permittee to make revisions to the Security Plan for the purpose of addressing the safety of persons and property. 
	(m)	One Time Event Permits are not transferable. The Permit is valid only for the Person to whom it is issued for the premises specified in the permit. 
	(n)	An applicant may seek immediate judicial review of an adverse decision by the Director under this Section pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 or Section 1094.8, as these provisions may be amended, including any successor provisions, or any other procedure provided by law. The applicant may, but is not required to, exhaust his or her administrative remedies before the Entertainment Commission and Board of Appeals.

SEC. 1060.29.1.  SPECIAL PERMIT PROCEDURE FOR ONE TIME EVENTS FOR DESIGNATED DAYS.
	(a)	The City has experienced difficulties meeting its basic duty to provide police, fire and emergency medical services (all "essential services") throughout the City on those occasions such as New Year's Eve, Halloween and the 4th of July where multiple simultaneous or overlapping events attract large crowds. The Board of Supervisors finds that the adoption of a special permit procedure for the review and processing of applications for One Time Events permits for these occasions will help ensure sufficient essential services to protect the safety of all residents of and visitors to the City, while accommodating special events to the extent consistent with the City's basic public safety obligations. By authorizing the adoption of a special permit procedure, the Board intends to encourage applicants to apply for One Time Events Permits sufficiently in advance of the event to enable the City to plan for the provision of essential services. Applicants who apply later may have to bear the additional cost of increased security that the City could have avoided with more advance notice. In addition, the Board is authorizing the Commission to place reasonable limits on the number of One Time Event Permits issued on these designated days to the extent that the Commission determines necessary to ensure public safety. 
	(b)	The Entertainment Commission may adopt a special permit procedure for One Time Events occurring on those designated days for which the Commission finds a substantial risk that the approval of multiple, simultaneous or overlapping One Time Events would (i) require the diversion of so great a number of Police Officers to police the events as to prevent adequate police protection to the rest of the City or (ii) result in a concentration of persons and vehicles that would unduly interfere with the proper delivery of essential services in the City. In making this determination, the Commission shall consider the need for the delivery of essential services both on the day of the event and until 6:00 a.m. the next day. 
	(c)	If the Entertainment Commission elects to adopt a special permit procedure under this Section, it shall first consult with the San Francisco Police Department. 
	(d)	This Section empowers the Entertainment Commission to designate no more than 12 days in a calendar year when the special permit procedure shall apply to applications for One Time Event Permits. 
	(e)	The Commission must adopt the procedure for each calendar year no later than November 1 of the preceding year. The Commission may adopt a procedure for multiple calendar years, in which case it may amend the procedure so long as it acts no later than November 1 preceding January 1 of the year to which the amended procedure applies. 
	(f)	The provisions of this Section supplement those set forth in Section 1060.29. Under the special permit procedure authorized under this Section, the following additional provisions apply: 
		(1)	For applications filed 40 days or more before the proposed event, the Commission may not disapprove the application on the ground that the City does not have adequate time to plan for the provision of essential services, although the Commission may disapprove an application under Subsection (f)(3) of this Section. 
		(2)	For applications filed less than 40 days before the proposed event, the Commission may
			(A)	Impose conditions on the permit that would not have been necessary had the applicant given the City more time to prepare for the delivery of essential services for the event and for the City as a whole on the day of the event. The conditions may require the applicant to bear additional costs for increased security, including requiring the applicant to hire and deploy Security Guards or implement other security measures for increased crowd control purposes and for monitoring to detect and stop illegal or dangerous behavior in connection with the event; or 
			(B)	Disapprove the application on the ground that the applicant filed too late to give the City adequate time to plan for the provision of essential services for the day of the event without compromising the safety and security of the rest of the City where alternative conditions cannot sufficiently mitigate the public safety and security problems that the event poses. 
		(3)	The Commission may disapprove an application for a One Time Event Permit for events proposed for one of the days designated under this Section, irrespective of the date of the filing, where (i) the conduct of the event, when considered in light of all other events occurring on the day of the event, will require the diversion of so great a number of Police Officers to properly police the event as to impair the capacity of the City to provide adequate police protection to the rest of the City and (ii) the Commission is unable to fashion conditions with which the applicant must comply that will address the public safety and security problems that the event poses. In considering whether to disapprove an application, the Commission may consider the number, size, and geographic concentration of proposed One-Time Events for the designated day. For purposes of this Subsection (f)(3), the "day of the event" includes until 6:00 a.m. after the designated day. 
	(g)	The special permit procedure may limit the number of permits issued for the designated days when the Commission finds a substantial risk that approval of all applications for One Time Events for that day would (i) require the diversion of so great a number of Police Officers to properly police all the events as to prevent adequate police protection to the rest of the City and (ii) the Commission is unable to fashion conditions with which the applicant must comply that will address the public safety and security problems that the event poses. In considering whether to limit the number of permits issued for a designated day, the Commission may consider the number, size, and geographic concentration of proposed One-Time Events for the designated day. If the Commission limits the number of permits, the Commission may authorize approval of applications on a first-come first-served basis, selection by lottery, or other method that is objective and fair and unrelated to the content of the Entertainment provided. In addition, the Commission may include a schedule of limits that vary depending on the size and location as they affect congestion that could impede prompt delivery of essential services. 
	(h)	The authority to impose conditions on days designated by the Commission under this Section includes the authority to require Permittees to comply with the conditions both on the designated day and until 6:00 a.m. the next day. 
	(i)	The Commission shall provide at least 10 days notice of the hearing to adopt or amend the special permit procedure. The Commission may provide notice electronically to Businesses then operating under a permit issued by the Commission and may, in addition, provide such additional notice as it deems best calculated to reach the entertainment community. 
	(j)	The Director shall post on the Commission's website the special permit procedure adopted by the Commission. The Director may also provide notice electronically to Businesses then operating under a permit issued by the Commission and such other notice that the Director determines is best calculated to reach the entertainment community. 
	(k)	The Entertainment Commission may delegate to the Director the authority to exercise all powers that this section creates except the power to adopt and amend a special procedure for One Time Event permits for designated days.

	(b)	Every Person holding a Place of Entertainment Permit, other than a publicly traded corporation, shall maintain a record of the name and address of every Person who directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the assets, ownership interests or voting interests in the Person holding the Permit, which shall be known as a "record of principal owners," and shall make the information available to the Entertainment Commission upon request. Every Person subject to this Subsection (b) shall report any change to the record of principal owners within 30 days of the transaction that effects the change. A "publicly traded" corporation is a company that has issued securities through an initial public offering which are traded on at least one stock exchange or over-the-counter market.

The Security Plan shall meet the minimum requirements of Section 1060(n) and any implementing rules and regulations. The Commission shall disapprove any Security Plan that it determines does not adequately address the safety of persons and property and provide for the orderly dispersal of persons and traffic, notwithstanding the compliance of the proposed Security Plan with the minimum requirements of Section 1060(n). 
	(c)	Every Place of Entertainment Permittee that does not have a Security Plan approved by the Entertainment Commission on the effective date of this Section shall submit a proposed Security Plan to the Director. 
		(1)	The Director shall mail notice of the requirements of this Section to each Permittee that does not have a Security Plan approved by the Entertainment Commission on the effective date of this Section. 
		(2)	Each Permittee shall submit a proposed plan no later than 30 days from the date of the Director's notice. Upon receiving a proposed plan, the Director shall send a copy to the San Francisco Police Department, which shall have 10 City business days to review and make recommendations to the Director. 
		(3)	The Director shall review each proposed plan and, after reviewing any recommendations submitted by the San Francisco Police Department, shall approve or disapprove it. When disapproving a proposed plan, the Director shall notify the Permittee what changes are required to obtain approval. 
		(4)	If the Director disapproves the plan submitted by the Permittee, the Permittee may appeal the Director's determination to the Entertainment Commission by submitting a written appeal to the Secretary of the Commission within ten days of the Director's disapproval. Upon receiving an appeal, the Commission shall promptly notify the San Francisco Police Department. When acting on an appeal, the Commission may approve, overturn or modify the Director's determination. If the Commission overturns the Director's order, the Permittee shall comply with the Security Plan as submitted to the Director under Subsection (c). If the Commission modifies the order, it shall set forth any changes to the plan that the Permittee shall be required to make and the Permittee shall comply with the Security Plan required by the Commission. 
		(5)	If the Commission approves the Director's order of if the Permittee does not appeal the Director's disapproval of the proposed plan, the Permittee shall comply with the Security Plan that includes the revisions required by the Director under Subsection (c)(3) of this Section. 
		(6)	The Permittee has 90 days from the date of the Director's notice under Subsection (c)(1) of this Section to gain approval of the Security Plan from the Director or the Commission in accordance with the procedures stated in Subsections (c)(1)-(5) of this Section. 
	(d)	The Entertainment Commission may suspend a Place of Entertainment permit as set forth in Section 1060.20.1(a)(5) if the Permittee has failed to submit a proposed Security Plan. 
	(e)	The Commission may suspend a Place of Entertainment permit as set forth in Sections 1060.20.1(a)(5) and 1060.20.1(a)(6) for failure to comply with the plan as required under this Article. 
	(f)	The suspension of a permit for violation of this Section may be appealed to the Board of Appeals as provided in Section 1060.24.2.
	(g)	For the purpose of calculating compliance with the component of a Security Plan that requires a ratio of one Security Guard to a specific number of individuals, a Security Guard may be counted toward the ratio for only one Place of Entertainment at any one time. This calculation rule applies whether the required ratio of Security Guard to individuals is based solely on the definition of Security Plan in Section 1060(n), is otherwise required by this Article, or is a condition of the Place of Entertainment permit. 
	(h)	Where the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, with the concurrence of the Director, determines that the public safety will not be advanced by enforcing on a particular Business with a Place of Entertainment Permit the requirement stated in Section 1060(n) that on Thursday and Sunday evenings there be a Security Guard for every 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit, the Chief or Chief's designee or the Director may notify the Permittee in writing that that Security Guard ratio based on Occupancy Permit shall not be required for that Business on Thursday and/or Sunday evenings. Such a determination may be based on all relevant factors, including but not limited to the past operation of the Business or related Businesses, but may not be based on the content of constitutionally protected expression or entertainment. Such a determination creates no vested right on the part of the affected Business to an exemption from the Thursday/Sunday requirement of one Security Guard per 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit, and said determination may be changed at any time by the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, or by the Director, upon written notice to the Permittee. For purposes of this Subsection (h), the Captain for the district where the Business is located, or the Captain's designee, is deemed the Chief's designee unless the Chief of Police directs otherwise.

	(b)	Notwithstanding the definition of "Security Plan" in Section 1060(n) of this Article and Section 1070(o) of Article 15.2, the Entertainment Commission, in consultation with the Police Department, may adopt a rule, applicable in those areas of the City where a conditional use authorization is required for a late night use, requiring that on Mondays, Tuesdays, and/or Wednesdays from 9:00 p.m. until closing (including early morning hours the following day), the Security Plan provide at least one Security Guard for every 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit during Entertainment events on the premises of the Business. In addition, notwithstanding the aforementioned definitions of "Security Plan," the Entertainment Commission, in consultation with the Police Department, may adopt a rule, applicable in any or all areas of the City, that on one or more designated days of the year or on particular days of the week, the Security Plan provide at least one Security Guard for every 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit during Entertainment events on the premises of the Business. In deciding whether to adopt a rule pursuant to this Subsection (b), the Commission shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to the expected attendance at Entertainment events on the premises of Businesses that would be affected by the rule on the days covered by the rule, past or anticipated problems with providing security at such events on those days, enforcement problems that may arise in the absence of the rule, and the anticipated economic impact of the rule on Permittees. This Subsection (b) does not limit or diminish the Commission's powers under Section 1060.29.1 of this Article.

Such a determination may be based on all relevant factors, including but not limited to the past operation of the Business or related Businesses, but may not be based on the content of constitutionally protected expression or entertainment. Such a determination creates no vested right on the part of the affected Business to an exemption from the requirement imposed by the rule of one Security Guard per 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit on Monday, Tuesday, and/or Wednesday, and said determination may be changed at any time by the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, or by the Director, upon written notice to the Permittee. For purposes of this Subsection (b), the Captain for the district where the Business is located, or the Captain's designee, is deemed the Chief's designee unless the Chief of Police directs otherwise.

SEC. 1070.20.  REVOCATION OF A PERMIT.
	(a)	Grounds for Revocation. The Entertainment Commission may revoke any permit issued under this Article if it determines after a public hearing that any of the following conditions exist: 
		(1)	The Permittee has knowingly made any false, misleading, or fraudulent statement of material fact or has knowingly omitted a material fact in the application for a permit. 
		(2)	The Permittee has failed to pay any fee or charge required under this Article.
		(3)	The Permittee has failed to surrender the permit as required by Section 1070.22(b).
		(4)	One or more of the grounds for suspension enumerated in Section 1070.17.1(a) applies, and considerations of public safety warrant revocation of the permit. For purposes of this provision, "considerations of public safety" means a substantial risk of physical harm or injury to individuals. In determining whether considerations of public safety warrant revocation, the Commission shall evaluate the likelihood and seriousness of the threat to public safety that continued operation of the Business under the permit presents. In making its determination, the Commission shall consider the following factors: (i) the history of violence and other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business; (ii) a pattern of the Permittee's noncompliance with Security Plan requirements imposed by law or as a condition of the permit; (iii) the frequency of the Permittee's violations of other provisions of law or permit conditions, which violations have contributed to violence or other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business; (iv) the degree to which the Permittee's action or inaction has been responsible for violence and other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business; and (v) the degree to which the City, through the Entertainment Commission, Director, Police Department, or otherwise, has notified the Permittee of violence or other public safety problems associated with the operation of the Business and/or of the need to take action to reduce such problems, and the promptness and efficacy of the Permittee's responses. 
		(5)	One or more of the grounds for suspension enumerated in Section 1070.17.1(a) applies, and revocation is warranted because the problems that those grounds have created have been serious and continuing, and the action or inaction of the Permittee contributing to those problems has been persistent; provided, that the circumstances warranting revocation under this provision would constitute a public nuisance within the meaning of Section 3480 of the California Civil Code. 
	(b)	Hearing by Commission. The Entertainment Commission shall give the Permittee and the Manager written notice of a hearing to determine whether to revoke a permit. The notice shall set forth the grounds for the proposed revocation and the date, time and location of the hearing. 
	(c)	Application for Permit After Revocation. The revocation of a permit under this Article shall not preclude the Permittee from applying for a new permit under this Article, except that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, including but not limited to Section 1060.5(f), revocation under Section 1070.20(a)(4) or Section 1070.20(a)(5) shall render the Permittee ineligible to apply for a new permit under this Article for one year from the date of revocation. 
	(d)	When considering whether to revoke a permit under this Article, the Commission and the Director shall consider any previous denial of a permit application or previous suspension or revocation of a permit, under this Article or Article 15.1, for the same permit applicant or Permittee when the circumstances warranting the previous action are relevant to the current determination.

	(f)	If the Director determines that disapproval of the application may be warranted, the Director shall schedule a hearing on the matter for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Entertainment Commission. The Director shall promptly provide written notice of the hearing to the Permittee and the Manager by mail and electronically. 
	(g)	The Entertainment Commission shall determine whether to approve the application according to the standards governing the initial application for an Extended-Hours Premises Permit (incorporating the standards set forth in Section 1060.5(f)).

	(a)	Every Extended-Hours Premises shall have a Security Plan, as defined in Section 1070(o), that has been approved by the Entertainment Commission or by the Director, as required by this Article. 
	(b)	As of the effective date of this Section, the Entertainment Commission shall not approve any permit or other application relating to a Business unless the applicant has a Security Plan that has been approved by the Commission or the Director as provided in this Article. The Security Plan shall meet the minimum requirements of Section 1070(o) and any implementing rules and regulations. The Commission shall disapprove any Security Plan that it determines does not adequately address the safety of persons and property and provide for the orderly dispersal of persons and traffic, notwithstanding the compliance of the proposed plan with the minimum requirements of Section 1070(o). 
	(c)	Compliance with the Security Plan approved under this Article is a condition of the permit.
	(d)	Every Extended-Hours Premises that does not have a Security Plan approved by the Entertainment Commission on the effective date of this Section shall submit a proposed Security Plan to the Director. The Entertainment Commission, the Director and every Permittee shall follow the procedures and standards set forth in Section 1060.31 of this Code for the approval of Security Plans under this Article. The Entertainment Commission may suspend a permit for the Permittee's failure to comply with the requirements of Section 1060.31 as required by this Subsection (d), including the failure to submit a proposed Security Plan and the failure to comply with an approved Security Plan. 
	(e)	For the purpose of calculating compliance with the component of a Security Plan that requires a ratio of one Security Guard to a specific number of individuals, a Security Guard may be counted toward the ratio for only one Place of Entertainment at any one time. This calculation rule applies whether the required ratio of Security Guard to individuals is based solely on the definition of Security Plan in Section 1060(o), is otherwise required by this Article, or is a condition of the Place of Entertainment permit. 
	(f)	Where the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, with the concurrence of the Director, determines that the public safety will not be advanced by enforcing on a particular Business with an Extended Hours Premises Permit the requirement stated in Section 1070(o) that on Thursday and Sunday evenings there be a Security Guard for every 100 individuals authorized by the Occupancy Permit, the Chief or Chief's designee or the Director may notify the Permittee in writing that the Security Guard ratio based on Occupancy Permit shall not be required for that Business on Thursday and/or Sunday evenings.

SEC. 1070.36.  PROSPECTIVE MORATORIUM ON GRANT OF EXTENDED-HOURS PREMISES PERMITS.
	(a)	Within two weeks on either side of the yearly anniversary of the effective date of Ordinance No. 238-09, the Entertainment Commission shall hold an annual hearing to determine whether there has been a substantial increase since the effective date of Ordinance No. 238-09 in the number of Extended-Hours Premises Permits in existence. To make this determination as to Extended-Hours Premises Permits at the first annual hearing, the Commission shall compare the number of such permits in existence at the time of the hearing to the number of such permits in existence as indicated in the report submitted pursuant to Section 1070.35(h). To make this determination at subsequent annual hearings, the Commission shall compare the number of such permits in existence at the time of the hearing to the number of such permits in existence at the time of the last annual hearing. 
	(b)	If the calculation mandated by Subsection (a) of this Section demonstrates an increase of 15% or more in any year in the number of Extended-Hours Premises Permits in existence and the number is at least 15% greater than the number of such permits in existence as indicated in the report submitted pursuant to Section 1070.35(h), there shall be a City-wide moratorium on the granting of additional Extended-Hours Premises permits. In lieu of a City-wide moratorium, the Entertainment Commission shall have discretion to impose a moratorium applicable only to certain geographic areas of the City in which there is a concentration of Extended-Hours Premises Permits. In this context, a "concentration of Extended-Hours Premises Permits" means geographic areas in the City that have the largest number of Extended-Hours Premises Permits and that cumulatively account for at least 70% of the Extended-Hours Premises Permits in existence as of the hearing mandated by Subsection (a) of this Section. In this context, the Commission may define "geographic areas" by reference to Police Districts, zoning provisions of the Planning Code, or other measures that are reasonable in light of other provisions in City law or commonly understood notions of the contours of various San Francisco neighborhoods. The Commission may exercise its discretion to impose the aforementioned moratorium applicable only to certain geographic areas if the Commission makes a finding on the record that considering all factors, including but not limited to economic and public safety concerns, such a moratorium is preferable to a City-wide moratorium.
	(c)	If a moratorium on Extended-Hours Premises Permits is imposed pursuant to Subsection (b) of this Section, the Entertainment Commission or Director, in consultation with the Police Department, Planning Department, and such other departments as the Commission or Director shall designate, shall conduct a study of the effects of the moratorium, as well as the effects of the substantial increase in the number of Extended-Hours Premises Permits in existence that gave rise to the moratorium. The study shall be completed no earlier than six months and no later than eleven months after the moratorium is imposed. The Entertainment Commission shall hold a hearing on the subject of the study within one month of completion of the study and shall make a recommendation regarding continuing, modifying, or lifting the moratorium. The Police Department and Planning Department shall participate in the hearing and other interested departments may participate in the hearing. Within three months of the Entertainment Commission hearing, the Board of Supervisors or a committee thereof shall hold a hearing on the same subject.
	(d)	Any moratorium under this Section 1070.36 shall only apply to Extended Hours Premises Permits for any premises where Entertainment is furnished or occurs upon the premises and shall not apply to any premises that serves food, beverages, or food and beverages, without Entertainment.

	(c)	Declaration of Public Convenience and Necessity.

	(d)	Hearings to Determine Public Convenience and Necessity. The Taxi Commission shall hold hearings to determine public convenience and necessity pursuant to all applications for the issuance of permits to operate motor vehicles for hire. Protests against the issuing of a permit may be filed with the Taxi Commission.

In all such hearings, the burden of proof shall be upon the individual applicant to establish by clear and convincing evidence that public convenience and necessity require the operation of the vehicle or vehicles for which permit application has been made, and that such application in all other respects should be granted. Subject to the provisions of Subsection (e) of this Section, hearings on applications for declaration of public convenience and necessity shall be held at least once each calendar year for each type, kind or class of permit for which one or more applications are pending. 
	(e)	Consolidation of Hearings Permitted. The Taxi Commission may consolidate for hearing and determination of public convenience and necessity all applications for a given type, kind or class of permit. Any declaration of public convenience and necessity made by the Taxi Commission pursuant to such a consolidated hearing shall be valid and binding as to the total number of permits authorized for a particular type, kind or class of permit and as to each application included for hearing in said consolidated hearing and shall have continuing force and effect until the next subsequent Taxi Commission hearing on public convenience and necessity as to that particular type, kind or class of permit.

A declaration of public convenience and necessity made at or as a result of a consolidated hearing under Subsection (e) of this Section may be appealed to the Board of Appeals as set forth in Section 4.106 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco. Prior to increasing the total number of authorized permits beyond the currently authorized number if the Taxi Commission has not authorized an increase, or beyond any increase authorized by the Taxi Commission, the Board of Appeals shall notify the Controller of the Board of Appeals' proposed increase and receive from the Controller within 30 days of the Controller's receipt of the Board of Appeals notice, a report including the Controller's recommendation for an adjustment in the mean gate fee cap and/or in rates of fare for taxicabs, and/or the institution of permit lease fee controls, necessary to maintain income of drivers and color scheme permitholders.

Each application shall be investigated and the results of the investigation shall be transmitted to the Taxi Commission at the time of the hearing on the applicant's individual qualifications. If public convenience and necessity is declared for the issuance of a permit and an applicant is found to be eligible therefor after consideration by the Taxi Commission of the factors set forth in Section 1081 of this Article, the Taxi Commission shall so notify the applicant. Within 60 days thereafter the applicant shall furnish to the Taxi Commission any and all additional information which may be required. If the Taxi Commission then finds that the applicant, in addition to complying with all other requirements, is the owner of the vehicle or vehicles for which a permit is sought, and that each such vehicle meets with all applicable statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, it shall thereupon issue the permit. A finding made at or as a result of a hearing under this Section may be appealed to the Board of Appeals as set forth in Section 4.106 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco. 
	(j)	Conditions on Permits. The Taxi Commission may attach such conditions as it deems to be consistent with public convenience and necessity upon any new permit issued under this Article.

No permit to operate a motor vehicle for hire shall be issued unless the person applying for the permit shall declare under penalty of perjury his or her intention actively and personally to engage as permittee-driver under any permit issued to him or her for at least four hours during any 24-hour period or at least 75 percent of the business days during the calendar year. 
	(c)	Driving Experience Required. No permit to operate a taxicab or ramped taxi shall be issued unless the applicant has the driving experience required by Section 1121 for a taxicab permit or Section 1148.1 for a ramped taxi permit. 
	(d)	Order of Consideration. Except as otherwise state in this Article, all applications for motor vehicle for hire permits shall be processed and considered in the order of their receipt by the Taxi Commission.

Permits
SEC. 1120.  TAXICAB PERMITS.
	It shall be unlawful to own or operate a taxicab in the City and County of San Francisco unless a taxicab permit has been issued by the Police Commission for the operation of that vehicle. Taxicab permits shall be applied for and issued pursuant to Sections 1079 through 1081 and this Division of this Article. 
(Added by Ord. 562-88, App. 12/27/88)
SEC. 1121.  PERMIT APPLICATIONS; PREFERENCES; DRIVING EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.
	(a)	Submission of Applications; Taxicab Waiting List. Applications for taxicab permits shall be accepted by the Taxi Commission and shall be recorded by the date and time at which each application is received. The Commission shall maintain a list in the order of receipt ("taxicab waiting list") of all taxicab permit applications that have not been acted upon, in excess of the number of such permits authorized pursuant to Section 1079. When a taxicab permit becomes available for issue and an applicant on the taxicab waiting list is eligible for a hearing before the Commission, the Commission shall so notify the applicant. 
		Each applicant for a taxicab permit must, at the time of filing the application: 
		(1)	Be a resident of the United States, of good moral character;
		(2)	Be 21 years or older;
		(3)	Be free of any disease, condition, infirmity, or addiction to the use of alcohol or any controlled substance, which might render the applicant unfit for the safe operation of a taxicab or any other motor vehicle for hire; 
		(4)	Be able to read and write the English language;
		(5)	Be clean in dress and person;
		(6)	Hold a valid California driver's license of a class sufficient for the lawful operation of the motor vehicle driven; and
		(7)	Have held a driver's permit pursuant to Section 1089 of this Article for two years immediately preceding the date of application for a taxicab permit. 
	(b)	Driving Experience Required. To qualify for issuance of a taxicab permit, an otherwise qualified applicant must have the driving experience specified in subparts (i)-(vi) below, subject to the modification stated in subsection (c). The required driving may be satisfied only by driving a taxicab and/or ramped taxi for which a permit has been issued by the Taxi Commission. For the purposes of this subsection (b), the phrase "application heard by the Commission during calendar year" includes an application publicly scheduled to be heard in the calendar year, but continued in that calendar year to the next calendar year by the Commission. 
		(i)	For an application heard by the Commission during calendar year 2004: The applicant must have been a full-time driver during the 12 months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on the application. For the purposes of this subpart (i), "full-time driver" shall be defined in accordance with Section 1076(o), except that the time frame applicable to the definition is the 12 months immediately preceding the hearing on the application rather than 12 months constituting a calendar year. 
		(ii)	For an application heard by the Commission during calendar year 2005: The applicant must have been a full-time driver, as defined in Section 1076(o), during calendar year 2005 or the 12 months immediately preceding the hearing on the application. 
		(iii)	For an application heard by the Commission during calendar year 2006: The applicant must have been a full-time driver, as defined in Section 1076(o), during calendar year 2005 or 2006.

		(vi)	For an application heard by the Commission during calendar year 2009: The applicant must have been a full-time driver, as defined in Section 1076(o), during any four calendar years from 2005 to 2009, inclusive. 
		(vii)	For an application heard by the Commission in calendar year 2010 and subsequent calendar years: The applicant must have been a full-time driver, as defined in Section 1076(o), for five years, as specified in Alternative 1 or Alternate 2 below. 
			Alternative 1: The applicant was a full-time driver during the calendar year immediately preceding the hearing, and during four of the five calendar years immediately preceding that calendar year. 
			Alternative 2: The applicant was a full-time driver during the calendar year in which the application is heard, and during four of the five calendar years immediately preceding that calendar year. (viii) When an applicant seeks credit as a full-time driver under this subsection (b) for the same calendar year in which his or her application is heard by the Commission, the Commission shall pro-rate the amount of driving required under Section 1076(o) against the portion of the calendar year that has elapsed as of the date of the hearing. 
		(ix)	The Commission may substitute an equivalent amount of prior full-time driving experience for the experience required under subsections (b)(i)-(vi) above, where the Commission determines after a public hearing that the applicant has been unjustly and systematically denied employment in the taxi industry in retaliation for engaging in legitimate political, expressive, or labor activity. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing such a claim, and any such determination shall require a two-thirds' vote of the Commission. 
	(c)	Modification of Required Driving Experience. If no applicant has the driving experience required pursuant to subsections (b)(ii)-(vi), but public convenience and necessity as determined pursuant to Section 1079 warrants issuance of a taxicab permit, the Taxi Commission may issue the permit to an otherwise qualified applicant who has been a full-time driver during the 12 months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on the application. For purposes of this first paragraph of subsection (c), "full-time driver" shall be defined in accordance with Section 1076(o), except that the time frame applicable to the definition is the 12 months immediately preceding the hearing on the application rather than 12 months constituting a calendar year. 
		The Commission may be regulation establish additional driving experience required for the issuance of a taxicab permit under the circumstances described in this subsection (c), provided that the regulation shall require neither greater driving experience than is required pursuant to subsections (b)(ii) -(vi) nor driving experience for any calendar year greater than the driving experience encompassed in the definition of "full-time driver in Section 1076(o). 
	(d)	Educational Requirements. In addition to meeting the driving requirements in subsection (b) and (c), applicants must also meet any educational or training requirements imposed by the Taxi Commission. 
	(e)	Burden of Proof on Applicant; Recordkeeping by Applicant. The taxicab permit applicant shall have the burden of showing that he or she has the driving experience required to qualify for the taxicab permit. The applicant shall keep records sufficient to document his or her driving for the calendar year or years necessary to satisfy the driving requirement. 
	(f)	Recordkeeping by Color Scheme Permitholders. Holders of color scheme permits shall maintain and retain records that will document driving performed by drivers of taxicabs and ramped taxis affiliated with the color scheme. Within 60 days of the effective date of this subsection (e), the Taxi Commission shall adopt a regulation requiring holders of color scheme permits to maintain and retain such records for a period of time sufficient to aid the Commission in determining whether applicants have met the specific driving requirements mandated by subsection (b). Failure of the Commission to adopt such a regulation, or failure of the color scheme permitholder to comply with the regulation, shall not excuse the permit applicant from the driving requirement or relieve the applicant from the burden of proving that he or she has satisfied the requirement. 
	(g)	Notice of Required Driving. Notice of the driving experience required of taxicab permit applicants pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and of the applicant's burden of proving the requisite driving experience and maintaining adequate records pursuant to subsection (d), shall be given by the City and color scheme permitholders pursuant to subparts (i)-(iii) below. In accord with Section 1148.1(e), the notice shall also include information pertaining to ramped taxi permit applicants. Failure to give the notice required by subparts (i), (ii), or (iii) shall not excuse the taxicab permit applicant from the driving requirement or relieve the applicant from the burden of proving that he or she has satisfied the requirement. The Taxi Commission may provide additional notice beyond that required by subparts (i)-(iii). 
		(i)	Within 30 days of the effective date of this subsection (f), the Commission shall give written notice of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) to each applicant on the taxicab waiting list. Thereafter, the Commission shall give written notice to each new applicant on the taxicab permit waiting list on or before the filing of the application. 
		(ii)	Beginning no later than 30 days after the effective date of this subsection (f), the Office of Treasurer and Tax Collector, in consultation with the Commission, shall give written notice of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) to each person who is obtaining or renewing the driver of public passenger vehicle permit. Said notice shall additionally inform the person of the existence of the taxicab waiting list and the process for getting on the list. 
		(iii)	Within 20 days of the effective date of this subsection (f), the Commission shall adopt a regulation requiring each holder of a color scheme permit to post written notice of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) at a location at the color scheme's place of business that is ordinarily within the view of working taxi drivers affiliated with the color scheme.

SEC. 1137.  REVIEW OF RATES OF FARE AND CAP ON GATE FEES.
	The rates provided in Sections 1135 and 1136 of this Article and the cap on gate fees provided in Section 1135.1 of this Article shall be reviewed by the Controller in even-numbered years, beginning with 2004. Not later than August 1st of each even-numbered year, the Controller shall transmit to the Board of Supervisors a determination as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees based upon changes in the Consumer Price Index since the prior determination, and related information submitted to the Controller pursuant to Section 1095(b) of this Article. The Controller's August 1, 2004 determination as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees shall be based upon changes in the Consumer Price Index since January 1, 2003, and related information submitted to the Controller pursuant to Section 1095(b) of this Article. In addition, the Controller's August 1, 2004 determination both as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and as to an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees shall include appropriate adjustments to ensure, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Section 1137.5 of this Article, that appropriate sums are collected to offset the increased monthly cost of paratransit scrip incurred by the paratransit program, except if the voters of the City and County of San Francisco have reauthorized a new sales tax to fund transportation. 
	The Controller's determination as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees shall take effect on November 1 of the even-numbered year in which the Controller makes the determination, and shall remain in effect through October 31 of the next even-numbered year, unless the following events occur: (i) By September 1 of the even-numbered year in which the Controller makes the determination the Board of Supervisors by resolution determines that the Board, or a committee thereof, should hold a hearing on the Controller's determination; (ii) by October 1 of that year a hearing is held in accordance with the aforementioned resolution; and (iii) by October 31 of that year the Board adopts a resolution disapproving or modifying the Controller's determination. Any resolution modifying the Controller's determination shall be based upon changes in the Consumer Price Index, costs recently incurred and expected to be incurred by drivers and color scheme permitholders, projected income of drivers and projected revenues of color scheme permitholders, and local economic conditions. If all three events occur, the Controller's determination shall not go into effect on November 1 of that year. 
	The Controller's determination as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees shall, beginning January 1, 2006, treat the higher mean gate fee cap of $91.50, provided for in Section 1135.1(b), as if it were $90.00 when instituted, and treat the higher meter rate of $2.85 for the first fifth of a mile or "flag," as provided for in Section 1135(a), as if it were $2.75 when instituted. In addition, the Controller's determination as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees shall, beginning January 1, 2006, make a similar accounting for any adjustments made in the Controller's August 1, 2004 determination designed to offset increased costs to the paratransit program arising from further increases in meter rates. 
	In cases where the holder of more than one permit to operate a sedan, limousine or taxicab fails to render a financial report within the time prescribed and in such form as the Controller may request, for the purpose of reviewing the rates of fare for taxicabs and the cap on gate fees and making a determination as to increases or decreases in the rates of fare for taxicabs and an increase or decrease in the cap on gate fees, such failure shall be a basis for cancellation of such permits by the Taxi Commission, provided such cancellation is approved by the Board of Supervisors. 
	Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, or any other provision of this Article, any change in the rates of fare for taxicabs and in the cap on gate fees based on the Controller's report for the even-numbered year 2008 shall not go into effect. The rates of fare for taxicabs and the cap on gate fees in effect on November 25, 2008 shall remain in effect.

SEC. 1137.5.  INCREASED COST OF PARATRANSIT PROGRAM.
	From January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006, MUNI shall calculate on a monthly basis the increased cost of paratransit scrip incurred by the paratransit program as a result of the increase in rates of fare for taxicabs provided for in this Ordinance or any increase in rates of fare for taxicabs resulting from the Controller's determination or any modification thereof as provided for in Section 1137. The increased monthly cost of paratransit scrip shall be divided equally among all taxicab permits in operation, to achieve an average increased cost per taxicab permit for each month. From January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006, that cost shall be allocated to color scheme permitholders on a monthly pro rata basis, dependent on the number of taxicab permits affiliated with each color scheme. By January 15, 2003, the Taxi Commission shall adopt procedures for calculating and collecting appropriate sums from color scheme permitholders to offset the increased monthly cost of paratransit scrip incurred by the paratransit program. If the voters of the City and County of San Francisco reauthorize a new sales tax to fund transportation, the Board of Supervisors shall convene a hearing to consider whether it is necessary to continue the program designed to offset MUNI's increased paratransit costs pursuant to this Section.

RAMPED TAXIS*
SEC. 1148.  PERMITS.
	It shall be unlawful to operate a ramped taxi in the City and County of San Francisco unless a permit has been issued by the Police Commission for the operation of said vehicle. Except as otherwise provided herein, permits for ramped taxis shall be applied for and issued pursuant to Sections 1079 through 1081 of this Article. 
(Added by Ord. 64-97, App. 3/6/97)
SEC. 1148.1.  PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
	(a)	Submission of Applications. Applications for permits for ramped taxis shall be made to the Taxi Commission on a form to be furnished by the Commission. An applicant for a ramped taxi permit must, at the time of filing the application, meet the same requirements as set forth in Section 1121(a) for an applicant for a taxi permit. Applications for permits for ramped taxis shall be accepted by the Commission and shall be recorded by the date and time at which each application is received. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Commission shall maintain a list in the order of receipt ("ramped taxi list"). In the absence of any preference provided for in this Division, applicants for permits for ramped taxis shall be processed and considered by the Commission in accordance with the order of application as set forth on the ramped taxi list. When a permit becomes available for issuance and an applicant on the waiting list is eligible for a hearing before the Taxi Commission, the Commission shall so notify the applicant. 
		As of the effective date of Ordinance No. 652-88, all persons whose application is already on "the taxicab waiting list" as provided for in Section 1121 of this Article will be placed on the ramped taxi list. Their place on the ramped taxi list shall be determined as of the date and time on which his or her application for the taxicab waiting list was received by the Commission. Those individuals so placed will remain on the taxicab waiting list until they are removed in accordance with Section 1080(c)(1) of this Article. 
	(b)	Limitation on Acceptance of Other Permits. All persons accepting a ramped taxi permit shall be precluded from accepting any other motor vehicle for hire permit regulated by this Article for a minimum of five years after receipt of a ramped taxi permit or, in the alternative, for a minimum of three years after receipt of the ramped taxi permit so long as six months have elapsed since the permittee gave notice of his or her intent to leave the ramped taxi program in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (c). If the permittee becomes eligible for a permit from another motor vehicle for hire waiting list at a time when the permittee is precluded from accepting the permit, the permittee's application will be kept active until a permit becomes available when the permittee is no longer precluded from accepting one. 
	(c)	Notice of Intent to Leave the Ramped Taxi Program. Upon completion of a minimum of 30 months as a ramped taxi permittee, the permittee may opt to leave the ramped taxi program by filing with the Taxi Commission a written notice of intent to leave the program. The date the Commission receives the notice of intent to leave the ramped taxi program shall be deemed the date the permittee filed the notice. Upon receipt of the notice, the Commission shall promptly inform a reasonable number of persons at the head of the ramped taxi list of the permittee's intent to leave the ramped taxi program. 
		In accordance with Subsection (b), the permittee's decision to leave the ramped taxi program shall become effective six months after his or her filing of the notice of intent to leave the program. Subject to qualifications (i) and (ii) below, upon completion of the six-month notice period, the permittee shall be required to leave the ramped taxi program, and shall no longer be precluded from accepting another motor vehicle for hire permit regulated by this Article. 
		(i)	If, at the completion of the six-month period, the permittee is not yet eligible for a permit from another motor vehicle for hire list, or no such permit is available, the permittee, at his or her option, may remain in the ramped taxi program for any period of time until the permittee becomes eligible for a permit from another motor vehicle for hire list and such permit becomes available. 
		(ii)	The permittee's decision to leave the ramped taxi program shall become inoperative if, within the first three months of the required six-month notice period, the permittee informs the Commission in writing of his or her decision to rescind the notice of intent to leave the program. The permittee shall be required to file a subsequent notice of intent to leave the program if he or she subsequently decides to leave the program. The same requirements governing the permittee's initial notice of intent to leave the program, including the full six-month notice period, shall govern any subsequent notice of intent to leave the program. 
	(d)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Taxi Commission may require that a taxicab permit to be issued to a ramped taxi permittee exiting the ramped taxi program be issued (i) three months after the Commission hearing on the application for the taxicab permit or (ii) when a new permittee has qualified for the ramped taxi permit and has acquired a suitable vehicle which has passed inspection, whichever event occurs first. Before the taxicab permit is issued, the ramped taxi permittee who is exiting the ramped taxi program shall retain the ramped taxi permit and continue to operate the ramped taxi permit. Under no circumstances may an individual simultaneously hold a ramped taxi permit and a taxicab permit. Under no circumstances may two individuals hold the same ramped taxi permit or taxicab permit. 
	(e)	Driving Experience Required. In order to qualify for a ramped taxi permit, an applicant must meet the same driving requirement stated in Section 1121(b) that an applicant for a taxicab permit must meet. In accordance with Section 1121(c), if no ramped taxi permit applicant has the requisite driving experience, but public convenience and necessity as determined by the Taxi Commission pursuant to Section 1079 warrants issuance of a ramped taxi permit, the Commission may issue the permit to an otherwise qualified applicant who has been a full-time driver during the 12 months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on the application. In accordance with Section 1121(d), a ramped taxi permit applicant has the burden of showing that he or she has the driving experience required to qualify for the permit, and shall keep records sufficient to document his or her driving for the calendar year or years necessary to satisfy the driving requirement. Failure of the Taxi Commission to adopt the regulation specified in Section 1121(e) requiring recordkeeping by color scheme permitholders, or failure of a color scheme permitholder to follow the regulation, shall not excuse a ramped taxi permit applicant from the driving requirement or relieve the applicant of the burden of proving that he or she has satisfied the requirement. 
		The notices required by Section 1121(g) shall indicate that the driving experience required by Section 1121(b) covers applicants for a ramped taxi permit as well as applicants for a taxicab permit. The notices required to Sections 1121(g)(i) and 1121(g)(ii) shall be given to applicants on the ramped taxi list as well as applicants on the taxicab waiting list, but if an applicant is on both lists, these notices need not be given twice to the same person. Failure to give the notices required pursuant to Sections 1121(g)(i), 1121(g)(ii), or 1121(g)(iii) and this subsection (d) shall not excuse the ramped taxi applicant from the driving requirement or relieve the applicant from the burden of proving that he or she has satisfied the requirement. 
	(f)	Preference for Full-Time Drivers of Ramped Taxis. Among the applicants whose names appear on the ramped taxi list, the Taxi Commission shall give preference to any applicant who has been a full-time driver of a ramped taxi during the 6 months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on that applicant's application, granting permits to all otherwise eligible full-time drivers of ramped taxis on the list before granting permits to others on the ramped taxi list. Any applicant seeking a preference pursuant to this Subsection shall, at least 21 days prior to the hearing at which the applicant seeks to be considered, so notify the Commission in writing and submit evidence to prove that the applicant was a full-time driver of a ramped taxi in the preceding 6 months. For purposes of this section, "full-time driver of a ramped taxi" shall mean a permitted driver who is actually engaged in the mechanical operation and having physical charge or custody of a ramped taxi as defined in this Article which is available for hire (i) or actually hired for at least four hours during any 24-hour period on at least 75 percent of the business days during the 6 months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on that applicant's application, or (ii) for at least 400 hours during the 6 months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on the application. 
	(g)	Wheelchair Pick-Up Requirement. To qualify for a ramped taxi permit, an applicant must have completed at least 100 wheelchair pick-ups as a ramped taxi driver during the six months immediately preceding the Commission's hearing on the application. If no ramped taxi applicant has completed the necessary wheelchair pick-ups, the Commission shall issue the permit to the applicant next on the list who has completed the most wheelchair pick-ups within the six months prior to the Commission's hearing, if the Commission determines that the public convenience and necessity requires the immediate issuance of the permit. A ramped taxi applicant has the burden of showing that he or she has completed the requisite number of wheelchair pick-ups to qualify for the permit, and shall keep records sufficient to document his or her performance.

SEC. 1148.3.  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ISSUANCE OF PERMITS.
	As part of the determination of public convenience and necessity for the issuance of one or more ramped taxi permits, the Police Commission shall, in addition to those considerations mandated by Section 1079 of this Article, take into account the availability of sufficient numbers of ramped taxi vehicles to meet safety and operating requirements imposed on permittees by this Article. 
(Added by Ord. 64-97, App. 3/6/97)
SEC. 1148.4.  PERMIT OPERATION.

In the absence of such requests for service, ramped taxis may transport any person in accordance with the provisions of this Article governing taxicabs.

(Added by Ord. 64-97, App. 3/6/97)
SEC. 1148.6.  USE OF RAMPED TAXI PERMIT IN SPARE TAXICAB.
	(a)	Authorization To Use Ramped Taxi Permit In Spare Taxicab. Notwithstanding Section 1120 of this Article or any other provisions of law, the Taxi Commission shall have discretion to adopt a policy that allows ramped taxi permits to be used for the purpose of operating a taxicab, as defined in Section 1076(b) of this Article, provided that (i) the taxicab is a spare taxicab, as defined by the Taxi Commission; (ii) the taxicab meets all applicable legal requirements for its operation; (iii) the ramped taxi permit cannot be used in the permitholder's ramped taxi because that vehicle is out of service for necessary repairs, or must be replaced due to breakdown of or damage to the vehicle; (iv) the ramped taxi permit cannot be used in a spare ramped taxi because none is available at the color scheme with which the ramped taxi permitholder is affiliated; (v) the use of the ramped taxi permit in a spare taxicab does not exceed the durational and fleet limits described in subsections (b) and (c); and (vi) in each instance the Taxi Commission or enforcement staff approves the use of the ramped taxi permit in a spare taxicab. The Taxi Commission or enforcement staff may impose additional conditions beyond those stated in subsection (a) for the use of a ramped taxi permit in a spare taxicab, to ensure that color scheme permitholders or ramped taxi permitholders do not abuse the authority to use a ramped taxi permit in a spare taxicab. 
	(b)	Durational Limits. Authorization to use a ramped taxi permit in a spare taxicab is limited to no more than 30 consecutive days. The Taxi Commission or enforcement staff may impose a shorter durational limit if repair or replacement of the ramped taxi permit in a timely manner would take less than 30 days. The Taxi Commission or enforcement staff may, for good cause shown, extend the durational limit beyond 30 days, in increments of no greater than 15 consecutive days, provided that in no event shall the total durational limit exceed 90 days. If, before a durational limit has been reached, repairs on the ramped taxi vehicle have been completed or replacement of the ramped taxi vehicle has been accomplished, the authorization to use the ramped taxi permit in a spare taxicab shall expire by operation of law. 
	(c)	Fleet Limits. If one to three ramped taxi permits are affiliated with a color scheme, only one ramped taxi permit may be used in a spare taxicab at any one time. For each additional three ramped taxi permits, or any fraction thereof, affiliated with a color scheme, an additional ramped taxi permit may be used in a spare taxicab. 
	(d)	Taxi Commission Enforcement. The Taxi Commission shall strictly enforce this Section to ensure that ramped taxi permits are not unlawfully used in spare taxicabs. Without limiting the Taxi Commission's enforcement remedies, violation of this Section by a color scheme permitholder or ramped taxi permitholder may result in suspension or revocation of the permit and/or in a determination that a color scheme may not use any ramped taxi permits affiliated with that color scheme in spare taxicabs.

The Chief of Police shall disapprove any security plan that the Chief determines does not adequately address the safety of individuals and vehicles in the parking garage or parking lot and within 25 feet of any pedestrian or vehicular entrance or exit to the parking garage or parking lot, notwithstanding the compliance of the proposed security plan with the minimum requirements of Subsection (c)(2) below. The Chief of Police shall not issue a commercial parking permit for any parking garage or parking lot unless the Chief approves the security plan for that parking garage or parking lot.

The phrase "1000 feet" in this Subsection (c)(2)(A) shall mean 1000 feet in all directions, including across a street, from any pedestrian or vehicular entrance or exit to the parking garage or parking lot;

		(5)	The authority of the Chief of Police to review and approve security plans for parking garages and parking lots does not restrict in any way the authority of the Entertainment Commission to place security requirements on any business with a Place of Entertainment or Extended Hours Premises permit.
	(d)	Action on Application. The Chief of Police shall hear and decide the application within a reasonable time after accepting the application for filing. In deciding the application, the Chief of Police may exercise his or her sound discretion as to whether the permit should be granted or denied. The Chief of Police may consider the following:

		(3)	Whether in the preceding ten years, the applicant or any person listed in Sections 1215.1(a)(2) through (4) has been convicted of or plead guilty or no contest to a covered crime, or has committed a covered crime.

			(a)	the nature and gravity of the offense; 
			(b)	the time elapsed since the offense;

SEC. 2900.  DECLARATION OF POLICY.
	(a)	Building on decades of scientific research, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have determined that persistent exposure to elevated levels of community noise is responsible for public health problems including, but not limited to: compromised speech, persistent annoyance, sleep disturbance, physiological and psychological stress, heart disease, high blood pressure, colitis, ulcers, depression, and feelings of helplessness. 
	(b)	The General Plan for San Francisco identifies noise as a serious environmental pollutant that must be managed and mitigated through the planning and development process. But given our dense urban environment. San Francisco has a significant challenge in protecting public health from the adverse effects of community noise arising from diverse sources such as transportation, construction, mechanical equipment, entertainment, and human and animal behavior. 
	(c)	In order to protect public health, it is hereby declared to be the policy of San Francisco to prohibit unwanted, excessive, and avoidable noise. It shall be the policy of San Francisco to maintain noise levels in areas with existing healthful and acceptable levels of noise and to reduce noise levels, through all practicable means, in those areas of San Francisco where noise levels are above acceptable levels as defined by the World Health Organization's Guidelines on Community Noise. 
	(d)	It shall be the goal of the noise task force described in this Article to determine if there are additional adverse and avoidable noise sources not covered in this statute that warrant regulation and to report to the Board of Supervisors and recommend amendments to this Article over the next three years. In addition, the noise task force shall develop interdepartmental mechanisms for the efficient disposition and any enforcement required in response to noise complaints.

SEC. 2901.  DEFINITIONS.
	(a)	"Ambient" means the lowest sound level repeating itself during a minimum ten-minute period as measured with a type 1, precision sound level meter, using slow response and "A " weighting. The minimum sound level shall be determined with the noise source at issue silent, and in the same location as the measurement of the noise level of the source or sources at issue. However, for purposes of this chapter, in no case shall the ambient be considered or determined to be less than: (1) Thirty-five dBA for interior residential noise, and (2) Forty-five dBA in all other locations. If a significant portion of the ambient is produced by one or more individual identifiable sources of noise that contribute cumulatively to the sound level and may be operating continuously during the minimum ten-minute measurement period, determination of the ambient shall be accomplished with these separate identifiable noise sources silent or otherwise removed or subtracted from the measured ambient sound level. 
	(b)	"Director" means the Director or department head of any City department having administrative or enforcement responsibilities under this Article or any other provision of the Municipal Code regarding noise control, as well as his or her designee.

The minimum sound level shall be determined with the music or entertainment noise source at issue silent, and in the same location as the measurement of the noise level of the source or sources at issue. However, for purposes of this chapter, in no case shall the local ambient be considered or determined to be less than: (1) Forty-five dBC for interior residential noise, and (2) Fifty-five dBC in all other locations. If a significant portion of the ambient is produced by one or more individual identifiable sources that would otherwise be operating continuously during the minimum ten-minute measurement period, determination of the low-frequency ambient shall be accomplished with these separate identifiable noise sources silent or otherwise removed or subtracted from the measured ambient sound. 
	(g)	"Noise level" means the maximum continuous sound level or repetitive peak sound level, produced by a source or group of sources as measured with a sound level meter. In order to measure a noise level, the controls of the sound level meter should be arranged to the setting appropriate to the type of noise being measured.

SEC. 3055.2.  PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW PRIVATE PROPERTY TOWING LAWS.
	(a)	Findings. The Board of Supervisors finds: 
		(i)	that there are frequent incidents of illegal towing from private property in San Francisco; and
		(ii)	that there is a significant risk to the safety of residents and visitors when illegal towing from private property occurs at night; and 
		(iii)	that there is a risk to public health and safety when the vehicles of senior citizens and persons with disabilities are illegally towed from private property; and 
		(iv)	that illegal towing from private property affects vulnerable populations when people of limited economic means are required to pay hundreds of dollars to recover their vehicle, or are subjected to deficiency claims by collection agencies if they could not afford to pick up their vehicle even though the vehicle was illegally towed; and 
		(v)	that the rights of vehicle owners when their vehicle is towed from private property, as described in the California Vehicle Code, are extremely difficult for citizens and visitors to find and understand, especially for non-English speakers or those who speak English as a foreign language; and 
		(vi)	that there are no accessible resources for people to research their rights and responsibilities with respect to private property tows; and 
		(vii)	that requiring tow car firms to provide information on the legal rights of vehicle owners at the time they reclaim their vehicle would be an effective way of informing vehicle owners of their rights under California law when their vehicle is towed from private property; and 
		(viii)	that preventing illegal conduct by tow car operators when towing from private property would reduce the economic burden on residents and visitors by eliminating the need to go to small claims court after a vehicle owner has already paid to reclaim the vehicle; and 
		(ix)	that consistent adherence to legal towing practices will substantially increase the quality of life for residents and the experience of visitors to San Francisco. 
	(b)	Definitions. For the purposes of this Article, "Brochure" shall mean a concise summary of California law, including the maximum rate that can be legally charged for a private property tow and the rights and responsibilities of all parties who participate in towing from private property: real property owners, vehicle owners, tow car operators and tow car firms. 
	(c)	Duties of tow car firm permittees. Every towing firm, or person to whom or for whom a permit to operate a tow car firm has been granted pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall display the Brochure in Chinese, Spanish and English in a conspicuous place in the location where a vehicle owner must come to reclaim their towed vehicle so that the Brochure may be easily seen by any person who is reclaiming their vehicle. A vehicle owner reclaiming their vehicle must also be able to take a copy of the Brochure in any language without assistance from any employee of the tow car firm and before they have paid to reclaim their vehicle. The tow car firm must maintain at least 50 copies of the brochure in each language on the premises at all times. 
	(d)	Duties of the Police Department. The Police Department shall: 
		(i)	Develop the Brochure within 30 days of the effective date of this ordinance; and
		(ii)	Arrange for translation of the Brochure into Chinese and Spanish; and
		(iii)	With the assistance of the City Attorney's Office, review the Brochure after July 1 of each year, and revise any provisions that are changed by state legislation or changes in public towing contract prices; and 
		(iv)	Arrange for production of the Brochure in sufficient quantities for all tow car firm permittees and any City department that wishes to display the Brochure; and 
		(v)	Provide copies of the Brochure and display stands that are adequate to display the Brochure in all of the required languages to any tow car firm permittee in sufficient quantities to ensure the tow car firm's compliance with this Section, and to City departments upon request; and 
		(vi)	Post the Brochure, contact information for the San Francisco Small Claims Court and the District Attorney's Office Consumer Protection Unit, and a list of current tow car firm permittees on the Police Department's website. 
	(e)	Funding. All costs of production, translation and distribution of the Brochure and display stands shall be recovered by the Police Department from the permit fees assessed for tow car firm and tow car operator permits. 
	(f)	Penalties and Enforcement. Any tow car firm that fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (c) of this Section may be assessed an administrative penalty by the Police Department in accordance with San Francisco Administrative Code Chapter 100, a copy of which is on file in Board of Supervisors File No. 081452 and which is hereby incorporated by reference. The penalty for a violation shall be $500.

		(1)	Within five years prior to the date of application the applicant has been convicted of any of the following crimes:
	Theft, petty theft, theft of a vehicle, breaking or removing vehicle parts, malicious mischief to vehicle, check fraud, credit card fraud, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, vehicular manslaughter, reckless driving bodily injury, any sex offense which would cause the applicant to be registered as a sex offender, any unlawful carrying, use or possession of a firearm, any assault or battery (misdemeanor or felony), kidnapping, arson, extortion, murder, possession of alcoholic beverage, opened alcohol container, marijuana, or narcotic drug while driving, or bailee tampering; 
		(2)	The imposition of towing, storage or other charges in excess of the maximum rate established by the City and County of San Francisco for its contracted tow car firms;

		(8)	Failure to report towed vehicles as required by law and Chief of Police rules;
		(9)	Falsification of any document used in the course of business as a tow car firm;

ARTICLE 33:
PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE, COLOR, ANCESTRY, NATIONAL ORIGIN, PLACE OF BIRTH, SEX, AGE, RELIGION, CREED, DISABILITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY, WEIGHT, OR HEIGHT
Sec. 3301.Policy.Sec. 3302.Findings.Sec. 3303.Employment.Sec. 3304.Housing.Sec. 3305.Business Establishments and Public Accommodations.Sec. 3305.1.Home Delivery Services.Sec. 3305.2.Association and Retaliation.Sec. 3306.Liability.Sec. 3307.Enforcement.Sec. 3308.Criminal Penalty.Sec. 3309.Limitation on Actions.Sec. 3310.Definition.Sec. 3311.Severability.Sec. 3312.City Liability Limited.
SEC. 3301.  POLICY. 
	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to eliminate discrimination based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, sex, age, religion, creed, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, weight or height within the City and County. 
(Amended by Ord. 184-81, App. 4/20/81; Ord. 433-94, App. 12/30/94; Ord. 222-02, File No. 021462, App. 11/15/2002) 
SEC. 3302.  FINDINGS. 
	After public hearings and consideration of testimony and documentary evidence, the Board of Supervisors finds that discrimination based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, sex, age, religion, creed, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, weight or height exists in the City and County of San Francisco. The Board finds further that such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the health, safety and general welfare of this community. Such discrimination foments strife and unrest, and it deprives the City and County of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advancement. The Board finds further that existing State and federal restraints on arbitrary discrimination are not adequate to meet the particular problems of this community, and that it is necessary and proper to enact local regulations adapted to the special circumstances which exist in this City and County.

Any person who believes that he or she has been discriminated against in violation of Sections 3303, 3305, and/or 3305.2 of this Article relating to employment or business establishments and public accommodations may file with the Human Rights Commission a request to have the Commission investigate and mediate his or her complaint under the provisions of Chapter 12A of the Administrative Code of the City and County of San Francisco. 
	(b) 	Human Rights Commission. 
		(1)	Any person or organization who believes that a violation of Sections 3304 and/or 3305.2 of this Article relating to housing has occurred may file with the Human Rights Commission a verified complaint in writing. 
		(2)	Upon the filing with the Commission of a verified written complaint, the Director of the Human Rights Commission or a designated member of the Commission staff, shall make, within 10 days, a full and prompt investigation in connection therewith. If, upon such investigation, the Director finds that the person charged in the complaint has not engaged in or is not engaging in such unlawful practice, such finding, in writing, shall be filed with the Commission and the complaint shall be dismissed. In addition to the other action the Director may or shall take, if, upon such investigation, the Director determines that probable cause exists for the allegations made in the complaint, the Director in his or her discretion may endeavor to eliminate the unlawful practice charged in the com- plaint by means of conciliation and persuasion. 
		(3)	If the Director determines there is probable cause to conclude that an unlawful act of discrimination has occurred, the Director shall ask the respondent to withhold the housing accommodation that is the subject of the complaint from the housing market. If the respondent does not agree to withhold the housing accommodation, the Director shall post on the door of the housing accommodation a notice stating that the housing accommodations are the subject of a complaint before the Commission. The notice shall remain posted until a final decision by the hearing officer. Any destruction, defacement, alteration or removal of the notice by the respondent or his or her agents shall be an infraction and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $250 nor more than $500. 
		(4)	If, at any time after a complaint has been filed, the Director determines that appropriate civil action to preserve the status quo or to prevent irreparable harm appears advisable, the Director shall refer the matter to the City Attorney for appropriate legal action. Appropriate legal action includes the seeking of injunctive relief to enjoin the owner of the property from taking further action with respect to the rental, lease, or sale of the property until the Commission has completed its investigation and made its determination. The Director shall notify the parties of such referral to the City Attorney and notify the complainant that he or she may initiate independently appropriate civil action to seek injunctive relief. 
		(5)	If the unlawful practice is not eliminated within 20 days after the filing of the complaint, the Director shall designate a person, other than a member of the Commission, to serve as a hearing officer. This person shall preside over a hearing at which the parties may offer such documents, testimony, written declarations or other evidence as may be pertinent to the proceedings. The hearing shall be recorded and all evidence preserved for the record. The hearing shall be held within 45 days of the filing of the complaint. 
		(6)	The hearing officer shall render a decision which shall include written findings of fact. The decision and findings shall be mailed within 30 days of the hearing. 
		(7)	If the hearing officer finds that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice in violation of this Article, the hearing officer shall issue an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the practice and to offer the housing accommodation to the complainant under the terms for which the unit was offered to the public. The respondent shall not be required to offer the housing accommodation to the complainant if the unit has already been rented by a tenant who has occupied the unit in good faith without knowledge of the pending complaint but the respondent shall be required to offer a comparable unit, if available, to the complainant. 
		(8)	The decision of the hearing officer shall be final unless the Commission vacates his or her decision on appeal. 
		(9)	Either party may file an appeal of the hearing officer's decision with the Commission. Such an appeal to the Commission from the determination of the hearing officer must be made within 15 days of the mailing of the decision and findings of fact. The appeal shall be in writing andmust state the grounds for appellant's claim that there was either error or abuse of discretion on the part of the hearing officer. Each appeal shall be accompanied by a $15 filing fee; provided, however, the fee shall be waived for an individual who files an affidavit under penalty of perjury stating that he or she is an indigent person who does not have and cannot obtain the money to pay the filing fee without using money needed for the necessities of life. The filing of an appeal will not stay the effect of the hearing officer's decision. 
		(10)	Upon receipt of an appeal, the entire administrative record of the matter, including the appeal, shall be filed with the Commission. 
		(11)	The Commission may in its discretion determine to hear an appeal. In deciding whether to hear an appeal, the Commission shall consider, among other things, fairness to the parties, hardship to either party and promotion of the policies and purposes of this Article. In determining whether to hear an appeal the Commission may also review material from the administrative record of the matter as it deems necessary. A vote of the majority of the Commission shall be required for an appeal to be heard. 
		(12)	In those cases where the Commission is able to determine on the basis of the documents before it that the hearing officer has erred, the Commission may without determining whether to hear the appeal remand the case for further hearing in accordance with its instructions without conducting an appeal hearing. Both parties shall be notified as to the time of the re-hearing, which shall be conducted within 30 days of the remand by the Commission. In those cases where the Commission is able to determine on the basis of the documents before it that the hearing officer's findings contain numerical or clerical inaccuracies, or require clarification, the Commission may continue the hearing for purposes of referring the case back to said hearing officer in order to correct the findings. 
		(13)	Appeals accepted by the Commission shall be heard within 45 days of the filing of an appeal. Within 30 days of the filing of an appeal, both parties shall be notified in writing as to whether the appeal has been accepted. If the appeal has been accepted, the notice shall state the time of the hearing and the nature of the hearing. Such notice must be mailed at least 10 days prior to the hearing. 
		(14)	At the appeal hearing, the parties shall have an opportunity to present oral and written argument in support of their positions. The Commission may in its discretion allow the parties to present additional evidence that was not considered by the hearing officer. After such hearing and after any further investigation which the Commission may deem necessary, the Commission may, upon hearing the appeal, affirm, reverse or modify the hearing officer's decision or may remand the case for further hearing in accordance with its findings. The Commission's decision must be rendered within 45 days of the completion of the hearing and the parties must be notified of such decision. 
		(15)	In accordance with the above subsection, the Commission shall give the parties written notice of the decision. The notice shall state that the decision is final. 
		(16)	The Commission shall adopt reasonable procedures to carry out the purposes of Section 3307(b). 
	(c)	Civil Action. Any aggrieved person may enforce the provisions of this Article by means of a civil action.

	(e)	Bar. A complaint to the Human Rights Commission is not a prerequisite to the filing of a civil action under this Section. The pendency of a complaint before the Human Rights Commission shall not bar any civil action under this Section, but a final judgment in any civil action shall bar any further proceedings by the Human Rights Commission.

PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION BY CLUBS OR ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE NOT DISTINCTLY PRIVATE
Sec. 3300B.1.Findings and Purpose.Sec. 3300B.2.Definitions.Sec. 3300B.3.Prohibition Against Discrimination.Sec. 3300B.4.Prohibited Practices: City Meetings.Sec. 3300B.5.Enforcement and Penalties.Sec. 3300B.6.No Criminal Penalties.Sec. 3300B.7.Severability.
SEC. 3300B.1.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
	After public hearing and receipt of testimony, the Board of Supervisors finds and declares that: 
		(1)	Discriminatory practices of certain clubs or organizations where business is frequently conducted and personal contacts valuable for business purposes, employment and professional advancement are formed are a significant barrier to the advancement of women and minorities in the business and professional life of the City and County of San Francisco. 
		(2)	While such clubs or organizations avowedly may have been formed for social or civic purposes, the commercial nature of many of their activities and the extent to which these activities have had a prejudicial impact on the business, professional and employment opportunities of women and minorities are of significant magnitude. 
		(3)	Business activity most frequently occurs in clubs or organizations which have more than four hundred members and which provide regular meal services facilitating the conduct of such business. 
		(4)	Employers often pay their employees' membership dues and expenses at such clubs or organizations because the employees' activities at said clubs or organizations serve to develop and enhance the employer's business. Such clubs or organizations also rent their facilities for use as conference rooms for business meetings attended by nonmembers. 
		(5)	Clubs or organizations where the above practices occur provide benefits to business entities and persons other than members and thus are not in fact "distinctly private" in their nature. 
		(6)	The City has a compelling interest in eradicating discrimination based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, sex, age, religion, creed, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, weight, or height in order to assure all of its citizens a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the business and professional life of the City. Conduct and practices which exclude persons from entry to, consideration for membership in, or the full advantages and privileges of such membership on these bases are discriminatory and unacceptable, and are injurious to the body politic, the business community and the City. Accordingly, the City's interest in eliminating such conduct and practices in clubs or organizations covered by this Article outweighs the interest of their members in private association. 
		(7)	While the Board of Supervisors recognizes the interest in private association asserted by club members, it finds that this interest does not overcome the public interest in equal opportunity. It is not the Board's purpose to dictate the manner in which certain private clubs conduct their activities or select their members, except insofar as is necessary to ensure that clubs do not automatically exclude persons from consideration for membership or unreasonably prevent enjoyment of club accommodations and facilities on account of invidious discrimination. Furthermore, it is not the Board's purpose to interfere in club activities or subject club operations to scrutiny beyond what is necessary in good faith to enforce this Article.

SEC. 3500.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors finds as follows: 
	(a)	The unauthorized use of firearms in the City and County of San Francisco is responsible for approximately two hundred injuries and approximately sixty deaths each year. 
	(b)	The cost of these needless deaths and injuries is generally borne by the injured parties and their families or by the public through the provision of police, emergency and medical services, even in those instances where the person using the firearm is convicted of a crime. The average cost of hospitalization for each person injured as a result of a shooting in San Francisco was approximately $12,128 as of 1996. The total monetary costs to the citizens of San Francisco each year due to these injuries and deaths as a result of hospital expenditures alone exceeds approximately three million dollars. 
	(c)	The manufacturers, importers and dealers of these firearms profit handsomely from the sales of firearms, but bear virtually no responsibility for the costs incurred as a result of the deaths and injuries caused by the use of their products in San Francisco 
	(d)	In order to promote and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of San Francisco, it is necessary and appropriate to reallocate the cost of injuries and deaths arising from the discharge of firearms by imposing strict liability upon the manufacturers, importers and dealers of those firearms, who are most able financially to accept these costs due to their ability to pass the costs on to consumers of firearms. 
	(e)	Imposing strict liability upon manufacturers, importers and dealers of these firearms for injuries and deaths caused by the firearms is appropriate because these firearms are designed to inflict serious injuries and death.

	(b)	Exemptions and Limitations.
		(1)	No action may be commenced pursuant to this section by any person who is injured or killed by the discharge of a firearm while such person is committing or attempting to commit a crime (whether or not such crime is actually charged), or while such person is attempting to evade arrest by a law enforcement official.

		(5)	No action may be commenced pursuant to this section by any person for a self-inflicted injury.
		(6)	No action may be commenced pursuant to this section where the firearm was equipped with an internal personalized safety feature at that time of its first retail sale.

SEC. 3600A.  STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND TEXT OF ORDINANCE PROHIBITING THE SALE, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND LIMITING THE POSSESSION OF HANDGUNS IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
	This ordinance is enacted to implement an initiative ordinance approved by the electors of San Francisco as Proposition "H" at the election held on November 8, 2005. The provisions of Proposition "H" are set forth herein for convenience and may only be amended as provided by law. Proposition "H" reads as follows: 
	"Section 1. Findings 
	The people of the City and County of San Francisco hereby find and declare: 
	1.	Handgun violence is a serious problem in San Francisco. According to a San Francisco Department of Public Health report published in 2002, 176 handgun incidents in San Francisco affected 213 victims in 1999, the last year for which data is available. Only 26.8% of firearms were recovered. Of all firearms used to cause injury or death, 67% were handguns. 
	2.	San Franciscans have a right to live in a safe and secure City. The presence of handguns poses a significant threat to the safety of San Franciscans. 
	3.	It is not the intent of the people of the City and County of San Francisco to affect any resident of other jurisdictions with regard to handgun possession, including those who may temporarily be within the boundaries of the City and County. 
	4.	Article XI of the California Constitution provides Charter created counties with the "home rule" power. This power allows counties to enact laws that exclusively apply to residents within their borders, even when such a law conflicts with state law or when state law is silent. San Francisco adopted its most recent comprehensive Charter revision in 1996. 
	5.	Since it is not the intent of the people of the City and County of San Francisco to impose an undue burden on inter-county commerce and transit, the provisions of Section 3 apply exclusively to residents of the City and County of San Francisco. 
	"Section 2. Ban on Sale, Manufacture, Transfer or Distribution of Firearms in the City and County of San Francisco 
	Within the limits of the City and County of San Francisco, the sale, distribution, transfer and manufacture of all firearms and ammunition shall be prohibited. 
	"Section 3. Limiting Handgun Possession in the City and County of San Francisco 
	Within the limits of the City and County of San Francisco, no resident of the City and County of San Francisco shall possess any handgun unless required for professional purposes, as enumerated herein. Specifically, any City, state or federal employee carrying out the functions of his or her government employment, including but not limited to peace officers as defined by California Penal Code Section 830 et. seq. and animal control officers may possess a handgun. Active members of the United States armed forces or the National Guard and security guards, regularly employed and compensated by a person engaged in any lawful business, while actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment, may also possess handguns. Within 90 days from the effective date of this Section, any resident of the City and County of San Francisco may surrender his or her handgun at any district station of the San Francisco Police Department, or to the San Francisco Sheriff's Department without penalty under this section. 
	"Section 4. Effective Date 
	This ordinance shall become effective January 1, 2006. 
	"Section 5. Penalties 
	Within 90 days of the effective date of this Section, the Board of Supervisors shall enact penalties for violations of this ordinance. The Mayor, after consultation with the District Attorney, Sheriff and Chief of Police shall, within 30 days from the effective date, provide recommendations about penalties to the Board. 
	"Section 6. State Law 
	Nothing in this ordinance is designed to duplicate or conflict with California State Law. Accordingly, any person currently denied the privilege of possessing a handgun under state law shall not be covered by this ordinance, but shall be covered by the California state law which denies that privilege. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to create or require any local license or registration for any firearm, or create an additional class of citizens who must seek licensing or registration. 
	"Section 7. Severability 
	If any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect other provisions or applications or this ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application. To this end, the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed severable. 
	"Section 8. Amendment 
	By a two-thirds vote and upon making findings, the Board of Supervisors may amend this ordinance in the furtherance of reducing handgun violence." 
(Added by Ord. 55-06, File No. 060151, App. 3/31/2006)
SEC. 3601A.  PENALTY FOR SALE, DISTRIBUTION, TRANSFER, AND MANUFACTURE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION OR POSSESSION OF HANDGUNS WITHIN CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
	(a)	In enacting Proposition "H" the voters required the Board of Supervisors to enact penalties for its violation. The following sections set forth the penalties for violation of Proposition H. 
	(b)	Any person who shall violate the provisions of Police Code Section 3600A that prohibit the sale, distribution, transfer and manufacture of all firearms and ammunition within the limits of the City and County of San Francisco or that prohibit the possession of any handgun within the limits of the City and County of San Francisco shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and by imprisonment in the County Jail not to exceed six months, or by both. 
	(c)	Any firearm or ammunition sold, distributed, transferred, or manufactured or any handgun possessed within the City and County of San Francisco in violation of the provisions of Police Code Section 3600A is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and shall be surrendered to the Police Department of the City and County of San Francisco. The Chief of Police is authorized to seize such firearms, ammunition and handguns and shall destroy or cause to be destroyed such firearms, ammunition and handguns, except upon the certificate of a judge of a court of record, or of the District Attorney that the preservation thereof is necessary or proper to the ends of justice. 
	(d)	This Section shall be enforced to the full extent of the authority of the City and County of San Francisco. If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this Section or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect other provisions or applications of this Section which can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application. To this end, the provisions of this section shall be deemed severable.

(Former Sec. 3700 added by Ord. 524-83, App. 11/4/83; repealed by Ord. 154-02, File No. 021078, App. 7/12/2002) 
SEC. 3701.  FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
	The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco finds and declares that: 
	(a)	The vast majority of emergency alarms to which law enforcement officials respond are false alarms. Most false alarms are the result of improper maintenance or improper or careless use of an alarm system. 
	(b)	The public and the police are subjected to needless danger when the police are called to respond to false alarms. In addition, police officers responding to false alarms are not available to carry out other police duties. In the interest of using limited law enforcement resources most effectively and efficiently, the number of false alarms can and must be reduced. 
	(c)	The purpose of this Article is to reduce the dangers and annoyances associated with the use of particular types of alarm systems and to encourage property owners to maintain their systems in good working condition and to use them properly. 
	(d)	A prolonged sound from an audible alarm system fixed to a motor vehicle is a public nuisance.

The Tax Collector shall evaluate the protest and notify the protesting party of the decision by mail within 30 days of receipt by the Tax Collector of all information and evidence. The notice shall include a copy of the Tax Collector's written determination. The Tax Collector's decision shall be final.
		(2)	In-Person Administrative Hearing. An alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company may protest the assessment of a fee or license revocation by paying the fee, if any, and filing a petition for redetermination pursuant to Section 6.13-1 of the Business and Tax Regulations Code. A hearing on the petition for redetermination of an assessment of a fee or license revocation shall proceed in the same manner as a petition for redetermination of a tax. Any reference in Sections 6.13-1 et seq. to taxes, penalties or interest shall be deemed to also apply to the hearing of  an assessment of a fee or license revocation under this Article. If the protesting party fails to appear for the hearing, a default judgment shall be entered against the party. The party will automatically be deemed liable for the fee or to have consented to the license revocation, together with any additional fees and interest.
		(3)	In any hearing conducted under subsections (b) (1) or (b)(2), the burden of proof shall be on the person protesting the assessment of a fee or license revocation to demonstrate that the assessment of the fee or the revocation of the license was arbitrary and capricious or beyond the jurisdiction of the Tax Collector.
	(c)	The Tax Collector or the hearing officer may adjust the count of false alarms based on:
		(1)	Evidence that a false alarm was caused by an Act of God;
		(2)	Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of the telephone company;
		(3)	Evidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage lasting longer than four (4) hours;
		(4)	Evidence that the alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm;
		(5)	Evidence that the police officer response was not completed in a timely fashion; and/or
		(6)	In determining the number of false alarms, multiple alarms occurring in any twenty-four (24) hour period may, in the Tax Collector's or the hearing officer's discretion, be counted as one false alarm, to allow the alarm user time to take corrective action unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm user. 
	(e)	With respect to penalties imposed against an alarm installation company or monitoring company, the Tax Collector or the hearing officer may take into consideration whether the alarm company had engaged in a pattern of violations.

ARTICLE 38:
PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AIDS AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS

SEC. 3801.  POLICY.
	It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to eliminate discrimination based on the fact that a person has AIDS or any medical signs or symptoms related thereto. In adopting this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors does not intend to proscribe any activity the proscription of which would constitute an infringement of the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the United States and California constitutions. 
(Added by Ord. 499-85, App. 11/20/85)
SEC. 3802.  FINDINGS.
	After public hearings and consideration of testimony and documentary evidence, the Board of Supervisors finds and declares that the medical condition described as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and commonly known as AIDS, is a deadly disease which has the potential to affect every segment of the City's population. AIDS was first recognized in 1981. It is now seen as the top priority of the United States Public Health Service. 
	AIDS is the most severe manifestation of a spectrum of clinical disease caused by a virus, variously known as human T-lymphotropic virus type III, lymphadenopathy-associated virus, or AIDS-associated retrovirus, which attacks and cripples the body's immune system by killing T-helper lymphocytes, thereby leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and malignancies. A person afflicted with AIDS can suffer a variety of viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections and malignancies which eventually lead to death, usually within one year after diagnosis. 
	The spread of the virus has occurred only through the exchange of body fluids, that is blood, blood products, or semen, between individuals. No evidence exists to indicate that the virus can be spread by casual person-to-person contact. Medical studies of families in which one or more members have been infected with HTLV-III/LAV/ARV show no spread of the virus other than through sexual intercourse or from mother to fetus in utero. Medical studies of hospital personnel caring for AIDS patients show no spread of the virus other than through needle sticks. The public health of the danger presented by the virus and its subsequent manifestations of AIDS-related complex and AIDS is caused by a lengthy asymptomatic period of infection during which an apparently healthy individual may unknowingly spread the disease to other persons through the exchange of blood, blood products, or semen. AIDS is concentrated primarily in urban areas, with the City and County of San Francisco having the largest incidence of the disease in the country. In the opinion of the scientific, medical, and public health communities, AIDS will continue to increase at a high rate within our City for the foreseeable future. 
	AIDS and AIDS-related complex by their nature have created a minority of our citizens who are afflicted with a seriously disabling condition whose ultimate outcome is fatal. Individuals infected with the virus represent a significant segment of our population particularly victimized due to the nature of their infection and to the present climate of misinformation, ignorance, and fear in the general population. Discrimination against victims of AIDS and AIDS-related conditions exists in the City and County of San Francisco. Persons with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions are faced with discrimination in employment, housing, business establishments, city facilities, city services, and other public accommodations. This discrimination poses a substantial threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the community. Existing state and federal restraints on such arbitrary discrimination are inadequate to meet the particular problems of this City and County.

In adopting this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors does not intend to proscribe any activity the proscription of which would constitute an infringement of any right guaranteed by the United States and California Constitutions. 
(Added by Ord. 195-86, App. 6/6/86)
SEC. 3851.  FINDINGS.
	After public hearings and consideration of testimony and documentary evidence, the Board of Supervisors finds and declares that discrimination in employment against persons with diseases and afflictions that cannot be transmitted by casual contact exists in the City and County of San Francisco. This discrimination cuts across all racial, ethnic, and economic lines. Such discrimination poses a substantial threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the community. Existing state and federal restraints on such arbitrary discrimination inadequate to meet the particular problems of this City and County.

SEC. 4001.  TITLE.
	This ordinance shall be known as the San Francisco Drug Free Workplace Ordinance. 
(Added by Ord. 339-89, App. 9/28/89)
SEC. 4002.  FINDINGS.
	The San Francisco Board of Supervisors finds as follows: 
	(a)	Drug abuse in the United States has become a national health and economic problem. As much as $100 billion a year may be diverted from legitimate businesses to buy illegal drugs, while the costs to individual companies usually exceeds 2.5 percent of payroll. 
	(b)	Law enforcement focuses on reducing the supply of illegal drugs. However, to reduce effectively the abuse of drugs the demand for such drugs must be reduced. 
	(c)	If employers persuade a major portion of the nation's drug users to abandon drug use for the sake of retaining their jobs, they will undercut the economic base of the drug business. Accordingly, it is important that there be a corporate response to drug use in the workplace. 
	(d)	It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors that the San Francisco Drug Free Workplace Ordinance be a first step in reducing the use of drugs in the workplace.

(Added by Ord. 339-89, App. 9/28/89)
SEC. 4004.  ADOPTION OF DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
	Every employer shall adopt a Drug Free Workplace Policy. At a minimum, that policy shall include the distribution or prominent display of educational information regarding the adverse effects of using illegal drugs and the availability of substance abuse assistance programs. This requirement may be satisfied by distributing to employees or prominently displaying the following statement or any materials containing the substance therein. The information contained in this statement shall be reviewed annually by the Health Commission for accuracy, with any suggested changes to the statement to be referred to the Board of Supervisors for review and consideration for approval. The information contained in this statement shall also be provided by the City in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog and in any other language as may be requested by employers. 
	The City and County of San Francisco is committed to working toward a drug-free work place. To that end, the following information is provided to increase your awareness that substance abuse can create life-threatening situations, can aggravate pre-existing psychological problems which users may or may not have experienced in the past, and can create psychological problems on its own: 
	1. 	Using illegal drugs, or using prescription drugs without prescriptions, or abusing any substance by ingestion, injection or inhalation, has the potential to kill the user. 
	Consider these facts concerning some commonly abused substances: 
-COCAINE, INCLUDING CRACK COCAINE, IS A KILLER•Every dose of cocaine poses the risk of death for the user.•The amount of cocaine used safely yesterday can kill the user tomorrow depending on his or her general physical condition, age, race, heredity, sex, emotional state, health, the amount of exercise engaged in, alcohol or other substance ingested. •Even one line of snorted cocaine has been known to kill the user.•Cocaine and crack kill by causing HEART ATTACK, BRAIN SEIZURE, CARDIAC ARREST, STROKE OR SUFFOCATION.•Even one use of crack has been known to cause addiction, but two usages WILL cause addiction.
-HEROIN IS A KILLER•Heroin depresses the user's breathing response and the user can die of SUFFOCATION.•Heroin users as a group have the second highest identifiable incidence of AIDS.•Since the early 1980's, users of heroin and synthetic heroin (particularly China White users) have run the risk of developing PARKINSON'S DISEASE-TYPE SYMPTOMS, including drooling, tremors and total paralysis, which begin to appear from two days to six weeks after usage and are irreversible. 
-STIMULANTS ARE KILLERS•Amphetamines and methamphetamines (SPEED) elevate heart and respiratory rates and blood pressure and the user can die of STROKE or HEART ATTACK. 
-PCP (PHENCYCLIDINE) IS A KILLER•PCP can cause the user to die from HEART ATTACK, LUNG FAILURE or KIDNEY FAILURE or RUPTURED BLOOD VESSELS IN THE BRAIN.•Even one dose of PCP can cause severe psychotic reactions.•PCP stores in fat cells and can be released into the body without warning many months after use causing severe trauma and injury. 
-LSD (LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE) IS A KILLER•LSD can cause life-threatening depression and severe psychotic reactions.•LSD users have a high incidence of SUICIDE.•LSD users have been known to engage in self-mutilation.
-MARIJUANA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PSYCHOTIC PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY IF THE USER HAS A SUBMERGED TENDENCY TOWARD PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS•Marijuana contains more cancer-causing agents than tobacco and weakens the immune-defense system.•Because of new growing techniques, the marijuana available today contains three to seven times as much THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient) as it did in the 1960s and 1970s and can cause severe depression and other physical and psychological problems. •Marijuana causes a temporary disruption in the delivery of the male hormone testosterone, particularly in adolescents and slightly decreases organ size in males (which may be critical to a user with hormonal imbalance or in the throes of puberty). 
-INHALANTS ARE KILLERS•Inhalants can cause NERVE DAMAGE, BRAIN DAMAGE, BLOOD DISORDERS, RESPIRATORY ARREST, PNEUMONIA, HEART FAILURE, SUFFOCATION, LIVER FAILURE, KIDNEY FAILURE and DEATH. •Solvent sniffing can cause death by ASPHYXIATION, but chronic users also develop ulcers around the mouth and nose and IRREVERSIBLE BRAIN DAMAGE has been reported. •Inhaling aerosol fluorocarbons can cause erratic heartbeat with an increased pulse rate and cardiac arrest (known as SUDDEN SNIFFING DEATH). 
-"DRUGS OF DECEPTION" ARE KILLERS•"Drugs of Deception," which are chemical compounds made in illegal labs and are designed to look like known substances of established strength and effect, are frequently more dangerous and more deadly than the original compound. •For example, "DOB" is often sold as LSD-25, and while it adversely affects blood flow like other amphetamines, it is extraordinarily strong and can partially or completely close arteries in arms and legs fairly quickly, causing gangrene and necessitating amputation to save the user's life. 
-ALCOHOL CAN KILL TOO!•Alcohol is one of the oldest psychoactive drugs used by man.•Alcohol abuse and alcoholism can cause damage, in some cases irreversible, to the brain, the nervous system, the liver and the pancreas. ••PANCREATITIS is a terribly painful disease which can kill the drinker.••CIRRHOSIS of the liver can kill the drinker.••Alcohol can have a dangerous addictive effect when combined with marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines and any sedative hypnotic such as barbiturates, methaqualone (quaaludes) and benzodiazepines. ••Withdrawal from alcohol can cause traumatic fatal brain seizures, psychosis and hallucinations.•In addition to its negative impact on good health, alcohol is a major factor…••In violent crimes and automobile accidents. In fiscal year 1987/1988, 60 percent of those stabbed to death in San Francisco were under the influence of alcohol as were 42 percent of the vehicle drivers killed in accidents on city streets. ••In over half of all rapes and sexual attacks of children.••In 90 percent of all arrests.••In 50 percent to 60 percent of all murders.••In incidents of suicide. Alcoholics have a suicide rate six to 20 times higher than the general population.••In more than 50 percent of spousal-abuse incidents.•Use of alcohol by pregnant women is the leading cause of mental retardation in newborns and causes FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME which can lead to SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME. 
-DRUG COMBINATIONS ARE KILLERS•Drugs in combination are likely to result in death.•Alcohol is a depressant and when used in combination with other drugs such as cocaine, barbiturates or heroin can slow body functions to such an extent that breathing may stop and the user may die. 
-ALTHOUGH NOT EVERYONE WHO USES DRUGS IS ADDICTED, ONCE ADDICTION IS IN PLACE, IT IS A DETERIORATING CONDITION THAT WILL RESULT IN DEATH IF NOT TREATED. 
-FREQUENT USAGE OR HIGH DOSES OF DRUGS WILL IMPAIR SEXUAL PERFORMANCE.
-THREE-FOURTHS OF ALL PERSONS ARRESTED FOR SERIOUS CRIMES IN SAN FRANCISCO TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS OR WERE HIGH AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRESTS. 
2. SUCCESSFUL WITHDRAWAL FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE OF ANY SORT CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Withdrawal from some substances (barbiturates, for example) even entails an acute risk of fatality. Additionally, a pregnant opiate addict poses an exceptional problem because the fetus will also be dependent; withdrawal of the mother and the baby must be postponed until after birth when both can be treated in order to prevent death of the fetus. HELP IS AVAILABLE FROM MANY SOURCES. Don't think you're by yourself-one in four workers abuses some substance. Professionals can protect your life, your health and help your family and friends too. •Substance abusers commonly distress and confuse those closest to them to such an extent that "CO-DEPENDENCY" is becoming a commonly acknowledged disease with recognizable-and treatable-symptoms. 
The following is a short list of some available professional programs and resources specializing in the treatment of substance abuse and its impact on others. You may also wish to consult your personal physician.

SEC. 4100.  FINDINGS.
	(a)	The City and County of San Francisco has declared that a public health emergency exists in connection with the AIDS epidemic and the high rate of HIV infection among injection drug users and the corresponding high rate of transmission of the disease. The Department of Public Health is implementing a needle exchange program in order to prevent the further spread of HIV infection. 
	(b)	Replicas of hypodermic syringes containing a red liquid are now being sold and possessed in the City and County of San Francisco. Many of the replicas are actually pens and pencils, or pieces of jewelry. The replicas are a serious public safety concern because there is no clear way to distinguish between real syringes and the replicas except on extremely close inspection. The replicas endanger the HIV education process by desensitizing persons to the seriousness of syringes. 
	(c)	Replica syringes may also be frightening to persons who do not know if the syringes are real or replicas. Replica syringes may, as a result, be used in a manner that may be taken as threatening or dangerous, and may result in unwarranted responses that may likewise by threatening or dangerous. The replica or facsimile hypodermic needles or syringes and their public display are, as a result, potentially threatening to persons in the community and to the safety and welfare of the general public.

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any replica or facsimile hypodermic needle or syringe which, because of its distinct color, exaggerated size, or other design feature, cannot reasonably be perceived to be a real needle or syringe. 
(Added by Ord. 136-93, App. 5/17/93)
SEC. 4102.  POSSESSION OF REPLICA HYPODERMIC NEEDLES OR SYRINGES.
	(a)	Prohibition of Public Possession. It shall be unlawful for any person, including a minor, to have in his or her visible possession in public areas a replica or facsimile hypodermic needle or syringe, the sale of which is prohibited by Section 4104 of the Police Code.

	(a)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Municipal Code, violation of Sections 4101 and 4102 shall not constitute a misdemeanor. The sole sanction for violation of these Sections shall be the confiscation and destruction of the prohibited replica or facsimile needle or syringe. Confiscation shall be made by law enforcement officers of the City and County of San Francisco authorized to make arrests, and may be made by any officials of the San Francisco Unified School District who may be duly authorized and designated to confiscate replica or facsimile hypodermic needles or syringes under these Sections. These officers or officials shall deliver possession of confiscated replica or facsimile hypodermic needles or syringes to the Chief of Police for the conduct of a hearing at which further retention of the replica or facsimile hypodermic needles or syringes and their destruction will be considered. Following an opportunity for a due process hearing the Chief of Police may order the return or destructions of said needles or syringes. 
	(b)	The Chief of Police is directed to establish procedures for hearings conducted by the Chief of Police or his or her designee that will be scheduled and conducted promptly after the confiscation of a replica or facsimile needle or syringe. The purpose of the hearing authorized by this Section will be to enable the person from whom the needle or syringe was confiscated, or the owner of the needle or syringe, to establish that the needle or syringe was not in visible possession in a public area, or was not a replica or facsimile needle or syringe within the meaning of these Sections in violation of these Sections at or before the time the needle or syringe was seized by the officers or officials.

ARTICLE 43:
ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
Sec. 4301.Findings.Sec. 4302.Definitions.Sec. 4303.Entering or Remaining in Buffer Zone at Reproductive Health Care Facilities Prohibited; Exemptions.Sec. 4304.Enforcement.Sec. 4305.City Undertaking Limited to Promotion of General Welfare.Sec. 4306.Article Accommodates Competing Rights.Sec. 4307.Severability.
SEC. 4301.  FINDINGS.
	Every person in the City and County of San Francisco ("City") has a fundamental right to privacy protected not only by the United States Constitution, but also explicitly guaranteed in Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution. This right to privacy includes the right to access all legal health care services, including reproductive health care services.
	Maintaining access to reproductive health care services is a matter of critical importance not only to individuals, but also to the health, safety, and welfare of all residents of the City. Efforts to harass, obstruct, or otherwise interfere with individuals seeking reproductive health care services may deter, delay, and even prevent individuals from obtaining necessary reproductive health care services. These efforts, which often include forcing patients to run a gauntlet of demonstrators near the entrances, exits, and driveways of reproductive health care facilities, or to confront intimidating demonstrators stationed at or near those entrances, exits, and driveways, also disrupt the ability of staff at reproductive health care facilities to devote their full efforts to providing health care services and divert valuable facility resources away from patients. Actions that result in such obstruction, delay, and deterrence of patients, and diversion of reproductive health care facilities' staff and resources, undermine the City's interest in maintaining the public health, safety, and welfare, and in preserving its residents' constitutional right to privacy.
	Standing on equal footing with the right to access health care services, including reproductive health care services, are the free speech and assembly rights of those who would gather and raise their voices on matters of public concern. Under this Article, the Board of Supervisors previously attempted to balance these rights by prohibiting harassment, within 100 feet of an exterior wall of a health care facility, of individuals entering, exiting, or seeking services at a health care facility, with harassment defined as "knowingly approach[ing] another person within eight feet of such person, unless such other person consents, for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with such other person." That prohibition has proven ineffective. Due to the density and space constraints of the City's urban landscape, that prohibition has not adequately prevented harassment, delay, and deterrence of patients seeking vital health care services, and in particular reproductive health care services, nor adequately prevented distraction and diversion of health care providers from their core mission of providing services in a safe and supportive environment.
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that the creation of a buffer zone, as defined in Police Code Section 4302 as amended by Ordinance No. 88-13, and a prohibition on entering or remaining in that buffer zone as specified in Police Code Section 4303 as amended by Ordinance No. 88-13, with certain exceptions, is necessary to promote the full exercise of the right to privacy by patients seeking vital reproductive health care services and is also necessary to maintain public health, safety, and welfare within the City. The Board of Supervisors further finds that this Article strikes a lawful and appropriate accommodation between the right to privacy and to access reproductive health care services and the needs of public health, safety, and welfare, on the one hand, and the rights of free speech and association, on the other.
	Article 43, as amended by Ordinance No. 88-13, applies only to reproductive health care facilities, no health care facilities generally. In addition. Article 43, as amended by Ordinance No. 88-13, does not apply to licensed hospitals or to reproductive health care facilities owned or operated by licensed hospitals. This scope ensures the Article is narrowly tailored to address the significant governmental interests it serves, and leaves other health care facilities and locations available for speech. Individuals attempting to access reproductive health care facilities to obtain reproductive health care services have been subjected to harassing or intimidating activity from extremely close proximity, tending to hamper, delay or deter their access to those facilities and services and thus subverting their legal rights to seek and obtain legal health care services. The Board finds that reproductive health care facilities that are not part of a licensed hospital, and not owned or operated by a licensed hospital, are more vulnerable to such subversion of their patients' rights on account of the layout and design of their facilities and parking areas as well as their staff resources and deployment. Further, reproductive health care facilities not affiliated with hospitals commonly possess fewer resources for providing adequate security and safety to individuals seeking access to reproductive health care services. Thus. Article 43, as amended by Ordinance No. 88-13 imposes narrowly tailored, content-neutral restrictions where they are most necessary to further the significant government interests the Article serves. 
	The Board finds that the modest scope of the buffer zone is sufficient to ensure that patients may gain safe and unimpeded access to reproductive health care services, while allowing speakers to effectively communicate their messages to their intended audience.
	The Board further finds that obstructions and demonstrations around the entrances, exits and driveways of reproductive health care facilities can impede pedestrian and vehicle traffic and create safety hazards on the sidewalks and roadways, and that this buffer zone will help promote safe and effective pedestrian and vehicle traffic flow around reproductive health care facilities. In addition, the buffer zone will reduce disputes and confrontations requiring law enforcement services, and will protect property rights.
	The Board further finds that harassing and intimidating activities conducted around the entrances, exits and driveways of reproductive health care facilities can adversely affect the physical and emotional health and well-being of patients seeking services at a reproductive health care facility. The Board finds that this buffer zone will provide a protective space for patients and thereby help avoid those adverse health consequences.
	The Board finds that this Article imposes content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on speech and association, which are narrowly tailored to serve significant government interests and leave ample alternative channels of communication.
	This Article is not intended to create any limited, designated or general public fora. Rather it is intended to protect those who seek access to reproductive health care from conduct that violates their rights.

SEC. 4303.  ENTERING OR REMAINING IN BUFFER ZONE AT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES PROHIBITED; EXEMPTIONS.
	(a)	Prohibition. Except as specified in Section 4303(b), it shall be unlawful for any person to enter or remain within a buffer zone.
	(b)	Exemption. Section 4303(a) shall not apply to the following:
		(1)	Individuals entering or exiting the reproductive health care facility. This exemption allows individuals to enter and pass through the buffer zone only while entering or exiting the reproductive health care facility. and does not permit those individuals to stop or remain in the buffer zone for any purpose, including but not limited to demonstration activity, or to engage in demonstration activity while entering or exiting the reproductive health care facility.
		(2)	Employees, agents, or volunteers of the reproductive health care facility. acting within the scope of their employment, agency, or volunteer service. This exemption does not allow these employees, agents or volunteers to engage in demonstration activity within the buffer zone, even if that demonstration activity is within the scope of their employment, agency, or volunteer service. 
		(3)	Law enforcement, emergency medical, firefighting, construction, and utilities personnel and federal, state, and municipal employees, acting within the scope of their employment. This exemption does not allow these individuals to engage in demonstration activity within the buffer zone.
		(4)	Individuals passing temporarily through the buffer zone to reach a destination within or on the other side of the buffer zone. This exemption applies to individuals who enter or pass through the buffer zone, without stopping, either to enter a residence or a business within the buffer zone other than the reproductive health care facility or to reach a destination on the other side of the buffer zone. This exemption does not allow these individuals to engage in demonstration activity while within or passing through the buffer zone. If an individual not subject to the exemptions in subsection (b)(1), (2), or (3) passes through the buffer zone five or more times in an hour, such activity will constitute prima facie evidence that the individual has violated Section 4303(a). The individual may rebut that presumption by presenting evidence that he or she has a legitimate personal or business, non-demonstration activity purpose for passing through the buffer zone.
	(c)	Business Hours. Section 4303(a) applies only during a reproductive health care facility's posted business hours.
	(d)	Marking and Written Notice. Section 4303(a) applies only if the buffer zone is marked by the Department of Public Works ("DPW") and a notice prepared by DPW is posted conspicuously near the buffer zone. A reproductive health care facility that wants its buffer zone marked and a notice posted shall submit a written request to the Department of Public Works ("DPW"). DPW shall measure and mark the buffer zone within 14 calendar days of the request. The DPW Director or designee shall prepare signs to provide to reproductive health care facilities, upon request, for posting. The signs shall provide notice regarding the prohibitions under this Article. The DPW Director or designee may adopt rules and regulations after a public hearing to set standards for marking and posting a notice at a buffer zone.
	(e)	Other Laws. Nothing in this Article shall preclude the enforcement of other state, federal, or municipal laws inside or outside of the buffer zone, including but not limited to those related to sidewalk obstruction.

SEC. 4306.  ARTICLE ACCOMMODATES COMPETING RIGHTS.
	In adopting this legislation, the Board of Supervisors recognizes both the fundamental constitutional right to assemble peaceably and to demonstrate on matters of public concern, as well as the right to seek and obtain health care. This legislation promotes the full exercise of these rights and strikes an appropriate accommodation between them. 
	It is not the intention of the Board of Supervisors to interfere with the right to protest, including the right to protest conditions of employment, outside of the previously defined buffer zone. Rather it is the intention of the Board of Supervisors to impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on all protest, to protect the right to seek and obtain health care. This ordinance does not prohibit conduct by a party to a labor dispute in furtherance of labor or management objectives in that dispute.

SEC. 4511.  FINDINGS.
	1.	Firearm injuries have a significant public health impact both nationally and locally.
		a.	In the United States, firearm injuries accounted for 6.6 percent of premature deaths from 1999-2007. Shootings are a leading cause of injury deaths in the nation, second only to motor vehicle crashes. On average, there were 30,125 firearm deaths in the United States annually between 2000 and 2007, inclusive. In 2007, 31,224 Americans died in firearm-related homicides, suicides, and unintentional shootings – the equivalent of 85 deaths each day and more than three deaths each hour.
		b.	Nationally, more than two thirds of homicides and over half of all suicides are committed with firearms.
		c.	Unintentional shootings killed over 5,700 people in the U.S. between 2000 and 2007. In 2009, over 18,000 people were treated for unintentional gunshot wounds in the United States.
		d.	The firearm-related homicide, suicide, and unintentional death rates for children 5-14 years old in the United States are significantly higher than those other industrialized nations.
		e.	Over the last five years, firearm injuries have ranked third of all causes of injury death in San Francisco, after pedestrian fatalities and falls, respectively. Almost two thirds of these firearm deaths were homicides. In addition, gunshot wounds were the third most common reason for injury-related hospitalizations in San Francisco from 2005 to 2008 and fourth in 2009. Firearm-related suicides accounted for 16.2 percent of the suicide deaths in San Francisco in Fiscal Year 2009-2010.
		f.	San Francisco General Hospital, as the only trauma center in San Francisco, treats approximately 98 percent of the city's shooting victims annually. Approximately 80 percent of the individuals treated for violent injuries at San Francisco General Hospital are uninsured.
	2.	Having a loaded or unlocked gun in the home is associated with an increased risk of gun-related injury and death.
		a.	A firearm stored loaded or unlocked increases the risk of an accidental shooting.
		b.	All U.S. case control studies (12 to date) have found that people who die by suicide are more likely to have lived in a home with a gun than similar people who did not die by suicide. Studies have also shown that the risk of suicide increases in homes where guns are kept loaded or unlocked.
		c.	A 2007 study compared the 40 million people who live in the states with the lowest firearm prevalence (Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and New York) to about the same number living in the states with the highest firearm prevalence (Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska, West Virginia, Montana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Iowa, North Dakota, Alabama, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Utah). Although non-firearm suicides were about equal in the two groups, total suicides were almost twice as high in the high-gun states.
		d.	Keeping unsecured guns in the home increases the flow of illegal guns into the community. More than half a million firearms are stolen each year in the United States and many are subsequently sold illegally.
	3.	Children are particularly at risk of injury and death, or causing injury and death, when they can access guns in their own homes or homes that they visit.
		a.	The authors of a 2005 study found that an estimated 1.69 million children age 18 and under are living in households with loaded and unlocked firearms. Many young children, including children as young as three years old, are strong enough to fire handguns.
		b.	A significant majority of the guns used in youth suicide attempts and unintentional injuries were stored in the residence of the victim, a relative, or a friend. Of youths under who died by firearm suicide, the vast majority used a family member's gun, usually a parent's. And more than two thirds of school shooters obtained their gun(s) from their own home or that of a relative.
		c.	Quick access to loaded firearms heightens the risk that a young person's impulsive decision to commit suicide will be carried out without reflection or seeking help, and that the impulsive attempt will be fatal. One third of youths who died by suicide had faced a crisis within the previous 24 hours. Among people who nearly died in a suicide attempt, almost a quarter indicated that fewer than five minutes had passed between deciding on suicide and making the attempt. While fewer than 10 percent of suicide attempts by other means are fatal, at least 85 percent of firearm suicide attempts end in death.
	4.	Guns kept in the home are most often used in suicides and against family and friends rather than in self-defense.
		a.	Guns kept in a home are more likely to be involved in an unintentional shooting, criminal assault, or suicide attempt than to kill or injure in self-defense.
		b.	Only one in ten firearm homicides in the shooter's home is considered justifiable, meaning the shooter was not the assailant. Of every ten firearm homicide victims killed at the shooter's residence, six were intimate partners or family members of the shooter, three were friends or acquaintances of the shooter, and only one was a stranger to the shooter.
	5.	Applying trigger locks or using lock boxes when storing firearms in the home reduces the risk of firearm injury and death.
		a.	Keeping a firearm locked when it is not being carried ensures that it cannot be accessed and used by others without the owner's knowledge or permission. This simple measure significantly decreases the risk that the gun will be used to commit suicide, homicide, or inflict injury, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
		b.	Safe storage measures have a demonstrated protective effect in homes with children and teenagers where guns are stored.
	6.	There is a wide consensus among medical professionals, police chiefs, gun control advocates and gun rights groups that applying trigger locks or using lock boxes to store unsupervised guns in the home promotes health and safety.
		a.	The International Association of Chiefs of Police recommends that state and local governments mandate safe storage of firearms.
		b.	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that if families must have firearms in their homes, the firearms should be stored locked, unloaded, and separate from locked ammunition.
		c.	Both gun control and gun rights advocates endorse the use of locking devices when storing guns to ensure that unauthorized or untrained persons cannot use the gun to inflict injury or death. For example, the National Rifle Association's Home Firearm Safety Handbook, developed and used as part of the National Rifle Association (NRA) Basic Firearm Training Program, emphasizes that "there is one general rule that must be applied under all conditions: Store guns so they are not accessible to untrained or unauthorized persons." The NRA Guide To The Basics Of Personal Protection In The Home further explains that "all storage methods designed to prevent unauthorized access utilize some sort locking method."
	7.	Requiring unsupervised firearms stored to be secured with trigger locks or in a locked container does not substantially burden the right or ability to use firearms for self-defense in the home.
		a.	The locking requirements apply only to handguns that are not being carried. Gun owners and adults over 18 may carry loaded and unlocked handguns in the home at any time. The safe storage requirements also permit owners who wish to do so to store their handguns fully loaded.
		b.	Gun security does not preclude quick access. For example, affordable lockboxes using Simplex-type locks, which pop open immediately when several keys or pushbuttons are touched in a preset sequence, are widely available. Users report that they can retrieve a loaded weapon in just two to three seconds, and that the locks are also easy to open in the dark. The NRA describes this type lockbox as providing "a good combination of security and quick access." Some lockboxes also feature biometric locks, which provide immediate access when they scan the owner's fingerprint.
		c.	Portable lockboxes can store loaded weapons such that they are always within easy reach on counters, tables or nightstands. Such safely stored weapons are more quickly and easily retrieved for use in self-defense than unlocked guns that have been hidden away in seldom-used locations.

PROHIBITING SELF-SERVICE MERCHANDISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS EXCEPT IN PLACES TO WHICH MINORS HAVE NO ACCESS
Sec. 4600.Title.Sec. 4600.1.Findings and Purposes.Sec. 4600.2.Definitions.Sec. 4600.3.Prohibition of Self-Service Merchandising of Tobacco Products Except in Places to which Minors Have No Access.Sec. 4600.4.Enforcement and Penalties.Sec. 4600.5.Other Applicable Laws.Sec. 4600.6.Voluntary Compliance.Sec. 4600.7.Disclaimers.Sec. 4600.8.Severability.
SEC. 4600.  TITLE.
	This Article shall be known as the Prohibition of Self-Service Merchandising of Tobacco Products Ordinance. 
(Added by Ord. 446-96, App. 11/27/96)
SEC. 4600.1.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
	The Board of Supervisors does hereby find that: 
	(a)	The United States Surgeon General and the United States Department of Health and Human Services have found that a majority of those Americans who die of tobacco-related diseases became addicted to the nicotine in tobacco products as adolescents, before the age of legal consent; 
	(b)	Studies have shown that seventy-five percent of current adult smokers started before the age of 18;
	(c)	The National Institute on Drug Abuse has concluded that the nicotine in tobacco products is a powerful addictive drug, and has identified nicotine addiction as the most widespread example of drug dependence in the U.S.; 
	(d)	The National Institute on Drug Abuse has found that tobacco use by adolescents precedes and is predictive of adolescent illicit drug use; 
	(e)	State law (Penal Code Sec. 308) prohibits and penalizes the sale or furnishing of cigarettes and other tobacco products to minors, yet minors continue to purchase, steal or otherwise obtain tobacco products at alarming rates; 
	(f)	In compliance with federal regulations, a new state law known as the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act or STAKE Act (Bus. and Prof. Code, Sec. 22950, et seq.) requires that tobacco retailers post a notice at each point of purchase stating that selling tobacco products to persons under 18 is illegal and subject to penalties. Tobacco retailers also are required to check the identification of tobacco purchasers if they reasonably appear to be under 18 years of age. The STAKE Act also requires state authorities to conduct random inspections to detect illegal sales of tobacco products and imposes civil penalties thereon; 
	(g)	Since minors are more likely to attempt to buy or steal cigarettes and other tobacco products when these items are accessible in self-service displays, banning self-service merchandising of tobacco products will help prevent routine violations of state law; 
	(h)	State law does not regulate the manner in which tobacco products are displayed and made available for sale;
	(i)	Effective August 1997, the new Federal FDA Regulations (Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents) prohibit the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products through self-service displays, except in facilities where individuals under 18 are not present or permitted at any time. 
	Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors finds and declares that it is in the public interest and welfare to prohibit the self-service merchandising of tobacco products. 
	The Board of Supervisors further finds that this Article is meant to complement and effectuate state law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors. 
(Added by Ord. 446-96, App. 11/27/96)
SEC. 4600.2.  DEFINITIONS.
	The following words and phrases, whenever used in this Article, shall be construed as defined in this Section: 
	(a)	"Business" means any sole proprietorship, joint venture, corporation or other business entity formed for profit-making or nonprofit purposes, including retail establishments where goods or services are sold. 
	(b)	"Person" shall mean any individual, partnership, cooperative association, private corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any other legal entity. 
	(c)	"Self-service merchandising" means the open display of tobacco products to which the public has access without the intervention of the vendor or a store employee. 
	(d)	"Tobacco product" means any tobacco cigarette or smokeless tobacco product.
	(e)	"Tobacco retailer" shall mean any person or business that operates a store, stand, booth, concession, or other place at which sales of tobacco products are made to purchasers for consumption or use. 
	(f)	"Vendor-assisted" means the customer has no access to the tobacco product without the assistance of a store owner or employee.

Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such. Any penalty assessed and recovered in an action brought pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco. The person against whom a penalty is assessed also shall be liable for the costs of attorney's fees incurred by the City and County of San Francisco in bringing any civil action to enforce the provisions of this Article. 
	(f)	For purposes of determining liability of persons, firms or corporations controlling franchises or business operations in multiple locations, each individual franchise or business location shall be deemed a separate entity. Violations accumulated and penalties assessed against a prior owner of a single franchise location shall not be accumulated against a new owner of the same single franchise location.

PERSONAL WATERCRAFT
Sec. 4700.1.Purpose.Sec. 4700.2.Definitions.Sec. 4700.3.Prohibited Use of Personal Watercraft in Special Use Area.Sec. 4700.4.State- or Federally-Funded Facilities.Sec. 4700.5.Violations; Enforcement; Penalties.Sec. 4700.6.Citizen Enforcement Actions.Sec. 4700.7.Severability.
SEC. 4700.1.  PURPOSE.
	The purpose of this ordinance is to reduce existing conflicts and limit potential conflicts between uses of the coastal waters of San Francisco, eliminate adverse impacts to the diverse and unusual species found in the San Francisco Bay, promote overall public safety, and decrease hydrocarbon pollution that is disproportionately caused by personal watercraft. 
	Conflicts between uses have the potential to increase in the future because of increasing development of shoreline areas. Examples of conflicts that currently occur are those between personal watercraft and individuals engaged in water sports such as kayaking, windsurfing, swimming, and canoeing, due to the nature and design of personal watercraft: high maneuverability, high speed, ability to travel in shallow areas, and noise patterns that are unique and annoying. 
	Conflicts also occur between shoreline uses in areas zoned for commercial and open space activities and personal watercraft because of the nature and design of these vessels. 
(Added by Ord. 285-98, App. 9/18/98)
SEC. 4700.2.  DEFINITIONS.
	(a)	"Landmarks" shall include, but not be limited to, the farthest extension of piers, beaches, seawalls, jetties, breakwaters and docks. 
	(b)	"Personal watercraft" means a highly maneuverable vessel which uses a waterjet pump to propel one or more persons and is capable of operating at planing speeds. "Personal watercraft" includes, but is not limited to, vessels referred to as Jetskis®, Sea Doos®, and Waverunners®. "Personal watercraft" shall include any vessel less than 12 feet, propelled by machinery, that is designed to be operated by a person sitting, standing or kneeling on the vessel, rather than the conventional manner of sitting or standing inside the vessel. 
	(c)	"Operator" means the person on board who is steering the vessel while underway.
	(d)	"Special-use area" means all or a portion of a waterway that is set aside for specified uses or activities to the exclusion of other incompatible uses or activities. 
	(e)	"Vessel" includes every description of watercraft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except either a seaplane on the water or a watercraft specifically designed to operate on a permanently fixed course. 
(Added by Ord. 285-98, App. 9/18/98)
SEC. 4700.3.  PROHIBITED USE OF PERSONAL WATERCRAFT IN SPECIAL USE AREA.
	(a)	Use and operation of personal watercraft in the area designated in Subsection (b) as a special use area is incompatible with competing uses and is therefore prohibited. 
	(b)	For purposes of this Article, the special use area shall consist of the area within 1,200 feet of the shoreline or the farthest extension of the shoreline of San Francisco, as defined by its landmarks. The San Francisco shoreline shall include, but not be limited to, all of Yerba Buena Island, all of Treasure Island, the east shore of Angel Island, all of Alcatraz Island, between Point Bonita and Yellow Bluff in Marin, and from Candlestick Park around the San Francisco Peninsula down to the extension of the County line below Harding Park. 
	In the event that another regulatory authority has exclusive jurisdiction over any of this shoreline area, the special use area shall begin at the boundary of the shoreline under the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco and extend out 1,200 feet. 
	(c)	There shall be a 200-foot wide access corridor for personal watercraft along the shortest route possible from Pier 52 through the special use area. There shall be a second access corridor, not to exceed 200 feet in width, for personal watercraft along the shortest route possible from the Gas House Cove marina fueling station through the special use area. The Gas House Cove corridor is designated solely for access to the fueling facility; personal watercraft shall not be allowed to launch from or land at Gas House Cove. The access corridors shall be marked by buoys or designated by other means chosen by the Police Department, and the speed limit in the corridors shall be five miles per hour. 
	(d)	The restrictions imposed by this Section shall not apply to the use of personal watercraft by Fire Department, Police Department, or Coast Guard personnel in the performance of search and rescue missions or other emergency or law enforcement operations. 
	(e)	Signs summarizing the relevant provisions of this Article shall be erected where personal watercraft have the ability to launch. These signs shall also provide a telephone number designated to accept calls by the public reporting violations of this Article.

SEC. 4700.4.  STATE- OR FEDERALLY-FUNDED FACILITIES.
	If the Port of San Francisco or any other officer, department or agency of the City constructs a recreational boat launch facility with funds provided pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 9504(b)(2), the Port Director or the responsible officer, department or agency shall designate, and the Board of Supervisors shall confirm by motion, an additional access corridor for personal watercraft from the facility and through the special use area.

SEC. 4700.6.  CITIZEN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.
	(a)	Any citizen may commence a civil action on his or her own behalf against any person who is alleged to have violated, or to be in violation of the provisions of this Article. For purposes of this Section, "citizen" shall mean either an individual who resides in the City; or a corporation, partnership or association that maintains its principal office in the City, and which has an interest which is, or may be, adversely affected. 
	(b)	In any action brought under this Section where the City is not a party, the City may intervene as a matter of right. Whenever an action is brought under this Section, the plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint on the City Attorney upon filing. No consent judgment or settlement shall be entered in an action in which the City is not a party prior to 30 days following receipt of the proposed consent judgment or settlement by the City Attorney. 
	(c)	The court in issuing any final order brought pursuant to this Section shall award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party who brought the underlying action, when the court determines such an award is appropriate.
