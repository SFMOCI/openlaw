PREAMBLE 
	Under the Burton Act and Charter Section B3.581, the San Francisco Port Commission has the complete and exclusive authority to manage, regulate and control the harbor of San Francisco and to do all things it deems necessary in connection with the use, conduct, operation, management, maintenance, regulation, improvement and control of Port property. The Port has important interests in regulating activities on public access areas of Port property to protect visitors from safety hazards, prevent damage to the property and facilitate special event coordination. As a result, the Port has determined that there is a need to impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions upon activities of the general public on the Port's public access areas. In keeping with its duties of administering the public trust, this Code is not intended to restrict the rights of the public to enjoy the waters of San Francisco Bay to the full extent those rights are granted under the public trust doctrine.

Such conditions may be imposed on a permittee after the permit application has been approved if information has been received by the Executive Director after such approval which would provide reasonable grounds for the conclusion that further conditions are necessary, including the condition that the location of the proposed activity be changed. The provisions of this Section are designed to secure for permit holders an opportunity fully to exercise the rights conferred upon them by the permit without unreasonably interfering with the rights of other members of the public to use park property and adjacent areas or to engage in First Amendment activities. The Executive Director shall in no event impose conditions pursuant to this Section which are designed to limit the content of First Amendment expression engaged in by persons affected by the permit or which unreasonably interfere with the right of free speech. 
	(B)	The conditions which may be imposed on permit applicants include the following: (1) posting a performance bond to insure the property is restored and cleaned at the conclusion of the permitted activity; (2) providing insurance to protect the City from liability from any harm that such activity might cause; and (3) agreeing to reimburse the Commission for any costs incurred by it in restoring damage to property caused by the actions of the permittee, its officers, employees, or agents, or any person who was, or reasonably should have been, under the permittee's control and to defend the City against, and indemnify and hold the City harmless from, any liability to any person resulting from any damage or injury cause by the actions of the permittee, its officers, employees, or agents, or any person who was or reasonably should have been, under the permittee's control.
	(C)	When an applicant for a permit to perform an activity which is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and for which a performance bond must be posted produces evidence that providing a cash performance bond would be impossible or so financially burdensome that it would preclude the applicant from using park property for the proposed activity, the Executive Director shall accept property in lieu of a cash performance bond so long as the property offered is of a type which will reasonably insure restoration and cleaning of the property to be used by the applicant at the conclusion of the permitted activity. 
	(D)	No applicant shall be required to comply with the provisions of Subsection (B)(2) pertaining to insurance if the activity proposed is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the applicant produces evidence that complying with those provisions is impossible or so financially burdensome that it would preclude the applicant from using park property for the proposed activity.

	(C)	The Executive Director has reasonable cause to conclude, based upon the inherent nature of the activity, that the applicant or any person or persons participating in the proposed activity will, in connection with that activity, cause physical injury to persons or substantial damage to property; provided, however, that in determining whether such reasonable cause exists the Executive Director shall not consider the content of expression which is proposed or anticipated;
	(D)	The proposed activity is inconsistent with the purpose for which the facility or area has been established or designated;

	(F)	The applicant fails to obtain necessary approvals, permits, or licenses from other governmental departments or agencies;
	(G)	The applicant has not complied with the procedural requirements established by Commission resolution for the filing of permit applications;

	(L)	The application contains misrepresentations of material fact;
	(M)	The proposed activity is prohibited by law;
