here applicable to call the user's attention to material that has been affected by legislation that has been passed but is not yet effective. Any references to such legislation are also compiled in a table at the end of this Code. The amendments are then
 incorporated into the Code when they become effective.

umbers), effective date, short title, and sections affected for each such ordinance. Users should note that the operative date of an ordinance may be later than the effective date of the ordinance. A delayed operative date will be noted in the ordinance.

ner's errors and the like found in the underlying ordinances). Such notes have been inserted by the publisher for the convenience of the user or as historical references. They have not been approved or adopted by the City and County of San Francisco, and
 are of no legal force or effect.

system and receiving waters pursuant to, and consistent with Federal and State laws, lawful standards and orders applicable to stormwater and urban runoff control, and the City's authority to manage and operate its drainage systems.

 nutrients, pathogens, oxygen-demanding substances, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, floatables, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), trash, and pesticides and herbicides. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (c)\tab During urban development, two important changes occur. First, where no urban development has previously occurred, natural vegetated pervious ground cover i
s converted to impervious surfaces such as paved highways, streets, rooftops, and parking lots. Natural vegetated soil can both absorb rainwater and remove pollutants, providing a very effective purification process. Because pavement and concrete can nei
ther absorb water nor remove pollutants, the natural purification characteristics of the land are lost. Second, urban development creates new pollutant sources, including vehicle emissions, vehicle maintenance wastes, pesticides, household hazardous wast
es, pet wastes, trash, and other contaminants that can be washed into the City's stormwater collection systems. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (d)\tab A high percentage of impervious area correlates to a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the stormwater collect
ion system, resulting in turbid water, nutrient enrichment, bacterial contamination, toxic compounds, temperature increases, and increases of trash or debris.

\nosupersub  The Board hereby finds and declares: The City has a compelling need to prohibit the posting of Signs on public property in order to prevent the visual pollution caused by such Signs and the resulting contributions to urban blight. Moreover, 
the placement of Signs on public property causes damage to such property and, when Signs are placed on or near traffic or directional signs or similar objects, threatens the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The rise in number, size and frequen
cy of Signs on public property has increased visual clutter, risks to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic and damage to public property. This proliferation of Signs on public property also threatens the character and dignity of the City's distinctive ap
pearance, streetscapes, thoroughfares, skyline and architectural features for both residents and visitors and also depletes limited public resources for street cleaning and maintenance. However, the Board is mindful of the importance of providing a forum
 for communication among citizens. While Lamp Posts and Utility Poles can provide such a forum, unrestricted use of Signs would interfere with the clear view of traffic safety signs and signals by motorists and with the unobstructed use of public streets
 and sidewalks. In addition, unrestricted use of Lamp Posts and Utility Poles would permit the placement of numerous Signs of widely ranging sizes and shapes which protrude beyond such poles, thereby creating an aesthetically displeasing clutter of objec
ts on and over public streets and sidewalks. A limitation on the size, duration, and placement of Signs on Lamp Posts and Utility Poles will eliminate unsightly clutter, ensure traffic safety, and provide an opportunity for a greater number of Persons to
 communicate by this means.

\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (a)\tab Findings. The Board hereby finds and declares that the City has a compelling need to prohibit the distribution of Handbills on private premises where the o
ccupant has expressed his or her unwillingness to receive such Handbills. Prohibiting distributions of Handbills in defiance of an occupant's expressed desire not to receive them strikes an appropriate accommodation between the rights of distributors to 
solicit willing listeners with the rights of occupants to object to receive the material. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub This Ordinance is also aimed at decreasing the adverse effects of the distribution of unsolicited Hand-bills on private premises. The prohibition against deliverin
g Handbills contrary to the expressed desire of the occupant and the requirement that Handbills be folded or otherwise attached to the outside of a premises will decrease the amount of litter created by Handbills.

\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (a)\tab The entire state of California is suffering from the effects of a fifth consecutive drought year, which include the reduction of available water supplies t
o extremely limited levels. Rationing programs have been established in most areas of the state, including the City and County of San Francisco. Although recent rainstorms have lessened the severity of the drought, existing water supplies remain at extre
mely low levels. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (b)\tab The drought highlights the need to permanently manage water resources in a prudent manner. The responsibility for management of San Francisco's water resou
rces is under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission ("Commission"). The Board of Supervisors should exercise its legislative authority to assist the Commission in achieving its goals. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (c)\tab The Commission has found that the use of high quality potable water for construction and demolition purposes in San Francisco is widespread. The use of suc
h water supplies is not necessary for many construction and demolition purposes. Non-potable water is available for such purposes from various sources, including wastewater reclamation facilities and permitted groundwater wells. Use of non-potable water 
from those sources for construction and demolition purposes would not present a health or safety hazard if used in accordance with applicable State Department of Health and State Water Resources Control Board standards and requirements. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (d)\tab The Commission has found that the use of increasingly scarce supplies of high quality potable water for soil compaction and dust control is no longer feasi
ble or in the public interest when appropriate substitute sources of non-potable water are available. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (e)\tab The Commission's findings are adopted by this Board. Furthermore, this Board finds that public interests in the preservation of high quality potable water 
for important human consumption uses would be best served by prohibiting the use of such water supplies for soil compaction or dust control when alternative supplies are available.

\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub The Board of Supervisors finds that: 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (a)\tab It is the responsibility of all water users in California to make effective use of available water resources. In San Francisco, water is distributed by the
 Water Department, a department of the Public Utilities Commission, which also supplies water to 2.6 million people in San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda counties. The San Francisco Department of Public Works constructs and operates wastew
ater reclamation facilities and administers building, plumbing and structural construction codes. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (b)\tab The comprehensive management of urban water supplies should consider programs for developing the use of nonpotable and reclaimed water supplies. The Depart
ment of Public Works discharges approximately 100 million gallons per day of treated wastewater into San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. If this wastewater is given further treatment, it may be capable of being used for irrigation and other nonpotab
le purposes, thereby reducing potable water demand, and potentially making water available for conjunctive use, groundwater recharge, and other environmental benefits. Further, groundwater in aquifers beneath San Francisco may be utilized for potable and
 nonpotable purposes. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (c)\tab In 1989 the Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 389-89 urging the Department of Public Works and Water Department to expand wastewater reclamation and r
euse in San Francisco. Preliminary feasibility studies prepared in 1989 indicated that reclamation could be a viable source of water for use within the City. Based on the results of the preliminary studies, the Departments began development of more exten
sive studies that will be completed in mid-1992. Preparation of these studies has involved many departments, including the Fire Department, Recreation and Park Department, City Planning Department, Department of Public Health, and several citizen and tec
hnical advisory groups. Public meetings have been held beginning in July 1991 and will continue for the duration of the projects. 
\par }\pard \tab {\b0\i0\ul0\strike0\v0\expnd0\expndtw0\outl0\shad0\f0\fs24\cf0\nosupersub (d)\tab If established, a comprehensive nonpotable and reclaimed water use program would result in the development of facilities to reclaim and reuse treated waste
