	Beginning with ordinances passed in 2011, all ordinances affecting this Code are summarized in a table that lists the identifying information (ordinance and file numbers), effective date, short title, and sections affected for each such ordinance. Users should note that the operative date of an ordinance may be later than the effective date of the ordinance. A delayed operative date will be noted in the ordinance.
	This Code may contain various Editor's Notes (explaining the disposition of or cross referencing various provisions), and/or Codification Notes (documenting scrivener's errors and the like found in the underlying ordinances).

Any utility or municipal excavator that does not propose major work in the next five years shall submit a plan with a statement that no such major work is anticipated and shall immediately report any major work to the Department as soon as it becomes reasonably foreseeable. 
		(ii)	The Department may disclose information contained in a five-year plan to any utility excavator or municipal excavator only on a need-to-know basis in order to facilitate coordination among excavators and to avoid unnecessary excavation in City streets. To the maximum extent permissible under federal, State, and local laws applicable to public records, the City shall not otherwise disclose to the public any information contained in a five-year plan submitted by a utility excavator that is proprietary, trade secret or is otherwise protected from disclosure; provided, however that the City shall have no duty to decline to disclose any information that the utility excavator has not identified on its face as proprietary, trade secret or otherwise protected from disclosure.

	(b)	Department Repaving Plans.
		(i)	The Department shall prepare a five-year repaving plan showing all proposed repaving and reconstruction of the public right-of-way. The Department's repaving plan shall be revised and updated on a semiannual basis after receipt of the five-year plans from utility and municipal excavators. In order to facilitate coordination and minimize the cost of excavation, the Department shall make its repaving plan available for public inspection. 
		(ii)	At least one hundred twenty calendar days prior to undertaking the repaving and reconstruction of any block, the Department shall send a notice of the proposed repaving and reconstruction to each utility and municipal excavator. 
	(c)	Coordination.
		(i)	The Department shall review the five-year plans and identify conflicts and opportunities for coordination of excavations. The Department shall notify affected owners and permittees of such conflicts and opportunities to the extent necessary to maximize coordination of excavation. Each applicant shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with each potentially affected owner and permittee to minimize disruption in the public right-of-way. 
		(ii)	When two or more applicants coordinate major work in the same block so that, in the opinion of the Department, such major work minimizes disruption to the affected neighborhood, and is likely to qualify the block for repaving, the Department shall make its best effort to schedule the affected block for repaving. Such scheduling shall occur, to the extent funds are available in the Street Damage Restoration Fund, so that the applicants may qualify for a waiver of the street damage restoration fee under Section 2.4.44(b)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this subsection shall interfere with the Department's authority to allocate available repaving resources in a manner that it determines best serves the public interest.

	Each permit, except one obtained by a municipal excavator, shall incorporate by reference and require the owner and its agent, if any, to comply with the liability, indemnity, insurance, and taxable possessory interest provisions set forth below in this Section; provided, however, that the Director, with the concurrence of the City Controller and City Risk Manager, may modify the indemnity and insurance provisions as they pertain to a particular permit. 
	(a)	Liability upon Owner and Agent. Each owner and its agent is wholly responsible for the quality of the excavation performed in the public right-of-way and both the owner and agent are jointly and severally liable for all consequences of any condition of such excavation and any facilities installed in the public right-of-way. The issuance of any permit, inspection, repair, or suggestion, approval, or acquiescence of any person affiliated with the Department shall not excuse any owner or agent from such responsibility or liability. 
	(b)	Indemnification, Defense, and Hold Harmless.
		(i)	Each owner and agent shall agree on its behalf and that of any successor or assign to indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless the City, including, without limitation, each of its commissions, departments, officers, agents, and employees (hereinafter in this subsection collectively referred to as "San Francisco") from and against any and all actions, claims, costs, damages, demands, expenses, fines, injuries, judgments, liabilities, losses, penalties, or suits including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs (collectively, "claims") of any kind allegedly arising directly or indirectly from: 
			(1)	Any act by, omission by, or negligence of, owner or its agent, contractors, subcontractors, or the officers, agents, or employees such entities, while engaged in the performance of the excavation authorized by the permit, or while in or about the property subject to the permit for any reason connected in any way whatsoever with the performance of the excavation authorized by the permit, or allegedly resulting directly or indirectly from the maintenance or installation of any equipment, facility(ies), or structures authorized under the permit; 
			(2)	Any accident, damage, death, or injury to any contractor or subcontractor, or any officer, agent or employee of either of them, while engaged in the performance of the excavation authorized by the permit, or while in or about the property for any reason connected with the performance of the excavation authorized by the permit, or arising from liens or claims for services rendered or labor or materials furnished in or for the performance of the excavation authorized by the permit; 
			(3)	Any accident, damage, death, or injury to any person(s) or accident, damage, or injury to any real or personal property in, upon, or in any way allegedly connected with the excavation authorized by the permit from any cause or claims arising at any time; and, 
			(4)	Any release or discharge, or threatened release or discharge, of any hazardous material caused or allowed by permittee about, in, on, or under the excavation site subject to the permit or the environment. As used herein, "hazardous material" means any gas, material, substance, or waste which, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, is deemed by any federal, state, or local governmental authority to pose a present or potential hazard to human health or safety or to the environment. "Release" when used with respect to hazardous materials shall include any actual or imminent disposing, dumping, emitting, emptying, escaping, injecting, leaching, leaking, pumping, pouring, or spilling. 
		(ii)	Upon the request of San Francisco, the owner or its agent, at no cost or expense to San Francisco, must indemnify, defend, and hold harmless San Francisco against any claims, regardless of the alleged negligence of San Francisco or any other party, except only for claims resulting directly from the sole negligence or wilful misconduct of San Francisco. Each owner and its agent specifically acknowledges and agrees that it has an immediate and independent obligation to defend San Francisco from any claims which actually or potentially fall within the indemnity provision, even if the allegations are or may be groundless, false, or fraudulent, which obligation arises at the time such claim is tendered to owner or its agent by San Francisco and continues at all times thereafter. In addition, San Francisco shall have a cause of action for indemnity against each owner and its agent for any costs San Francisco may be required to pay as a result of defending or satisfying any claims that arise from or in connection with the permit, except only for claims resulting directly from the sole negligence or wilful misconduct of San Francisco. Owner and its agent agree that the indemnification obligations assumed under the permit shall survive expiration of the permit or completion of excavation. 
	(c)	Insurance.
		(i)	Each owner or its agent shall maintain in full force and effect, throughout the term of the permit, an insurance policy or policies issued by an insurance company or companies satisfactory to the City's Controller and Risk Manager. Policy or policies shall afford insurance covering all operations, vehicles, and employees, as follows: 
			(1)	Workers' Compensation with employers' liability limits not less than $1,000,000 each accident;
			(2)	Commercial general liability insurance with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage, including contractual liability; personal injury; explosion, collapse, and underground (xcu); products; and completed operations; 
			(3)	Business automobile liability insurance with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage, including owned, nonowned, and hired auto coverage, as applicable; 
			(4)	Contractors' pollution liability insurance, on an occurrence form, with limits not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage and any deductible not to exceed $25,000 each occurrence. 
		(ii)	Said policy or policies shall include the City and its officers and employees jointly and severally as additional insureds, shall apply as primary insurance, shall stipulate that no other insurance effected by the City will be called on to contribute to a loss covered thereunder, and shall provide for severability of interests. Said policy or policies shall provide that an act or omission of one insured, which would void or otherwise reduce coverage, shall not reduce or void the coverage as to any other insured. Said policy or policies shall afford full coverage for any claims based on acts, omissions, injury, or damage which occurred or arose, or the onset of which occurred or arose, in whole or in part, during the policy period. Said policy or policies shall be endorsed to provide 30 calendar days advance written notice of cancellation or any material change to the Department. 
		(iii)	Should any of the required insurance be provided under a claims-made form, the insured owner or its agent shall maintain such coverage continuously throughout the term of the permit, and, without lapse, for a period of three years beyond the expiration or termination of the permit, to the effect that, should occurrences during the term of the permit give rise to claims made after expiration or termination of the permit, such claims shall be covered by such claims-made policies. 
		(iv)	Should any of the required insurance be provided under a form of coverage that includes a general annual aggregate limit or provides that claims investigation or legal defense costs be included in such general annual aggregate limit, such general aggregate limit shall be double the occurrence or claims limits specified above in Subsection (c)(i). 
		(v)	Such insurance shall in no way relieve or decrease owner's and its agent's obligation to indemnify the City under Subsection (b) or any other provision of this Article. 
		(vi)	Certificates of insurance, in the form satisfactory to the Department, evidencing all coverages above, shall be furnished to or maintained on file with the Department before issuance of a permit, with complete copies of policies furnished promptly upon the Department's request. 
		(vii)	Where an owner is self-insured, and such insurance is no less broad and affords no less protection to the City than the requirements specified above in Subsection (c), the Department, in consultation with the City's Controller and Risk Manager, may accept such insurance as satisfying the requirements of Subsection (c). Evidence of such insurance shall be provided in the manner specified in Subsection (c)(vi). 
	(d)	Taxable Possessory Interest. Each owner shall acknowledge on its behalf and that of any successor or assign that its permit incorporates the following statements: The owner of the facility(ies) for which the permit to excavate was obtained recognizes and understands that the permit may create a possessory interest subject to property taxation and that owner may be subject to the payment of property taxes levied on such interest under applicable law. Owner agrees to pay taxes of any kind, including possessory interest taxes, if any, that may be lawfully assessed on owner's interest under the permit to excavate or for use of the public right-of-way and to pay other excises, licenses, taxes, or permit charges or assessments based on owner's usage of the public right-of-way that may be imposed on owner by applicable law. Owner shall pay all of such charges when they become due and before delinquency.

(Added by Ord. 115-97, App. 3/28/97)
SEC. 140.  CONTROL OF FATS, OILS AND GREASE.
	a.	Sections 140--140.7 of this Article provide requirements for the control of the discharge of fats, oils and grease to the City's sewerage system. Large quantities of fats, oil and grease that are discharged from commercial and residential kitchens contribute to blockages in the City's sewerage system. The resulting clogs in sewer pipes cost the City millions of dollars each year in grease removal and sewer repair costs, and result in the overall degradation of the City's sewer infrastructure. 
	b.	This Article facilitates implementation of a comprehensive pollution prevention program to keep fats, oils and grease out of the City's sewer system, and compliance with the City's current Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits and the Sanitary Sewer Overflow Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) permit, which are issued by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). 
	c.	The US EPA promotes the development of fats, oils and grease control programs throughout the country because approximately 40,000 fats, oils and grease-related sanitary sewer overflows that have the potential to contaminate the nation's water bodies occur each year. Nationwide, wastewater utilities have been sued for violations of the Clean Water Act caused by sanitary sewer overflows. 
	d.	The City's aggressive efforts to control fats, oils and grease will enhance its compliance with the Clean Water Act, and also reduce the potential for system back-ups from the combined sewer system. 
	e.	The primary objective of sections 140-140.7 of this Article is to reduce fats, oils and grease discharges from local food service establishments into the City's sewerage system. Food service establishments are required by current regulations to comply with a limit on the amount of total oil and grease they can discharge into City sewers. This discharge limit has not been completely effective in keeping fats, oils and grease out of the sewers. Many food service establishments have grease capturing equipment that is not well maintained or serviced and does little to remove grease from wastewater discharges. Other food service establishments have no grease capturing equipment at all. 
	f.	Sections 140-140.7 of this Article will:
		1.	Provide standards for the types of grease capturing equipment that must be installed by food service establishments;
		2.	Provide for the effective long-term use of grease capturing equipment through related operational requirements and prohibitions, and periodic inspections; 
		3.	Increase opportunities for recovering from wastewater discharge lines both food solids (which can be composted) and waste grease (which can be recycled, and may also be able to be converted to biofuel); 
		4.	Aid in preventing sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulation of fats, oils and grease in the sanitary sewerage system; 
		5.	Prevent the uncontrolled introduction of fats, oils and grease into the sewage system that will interfere with its operation; and 
		6.	Facilitate City compliance with applicable federal and state laws regarding sewerage system operations.

	The provisions of sections 118-139 of this Article apply to the discharge of fats, oils and grease to the City's sewerage system, except to the extent different requirements or procedures are provided in sections 140.1-140.7 of this Article. Sections 140.1-140.7 of this Article are intended to complement, rather than supersede, the provisions of City building codes and regulations applicable to the installation and operation of grease capturing equipment. Sections 140-140.7 shall be effective on and after April 1, 2011.

	(b)	Urban runoff is a significant cause of pollution throughout California. Pollutants of concern found in urban runoff include sediments, non-sediment solids, nutrients, pathogens, oxygen-demanding substances, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, floatables, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), trash, and pesticides and herbicides. 
	(c)	During urban development, two important changes occur. First, where no urban development has previously occurred, natural vegetated pervious ground cover is converted to impervious surfaces such as paved highways, streets, rooftops, and parking lots. Natural vegetated soil can both absorb rainwater and remove pollutants, providing a very effective purification process. Because pavement and concrete can neither absorb water nor remove pollutants, the natural purification characteristics of the land are lost. Second, urban development creates new pollutant sources, including vehicle emissions, vehicle maintenance wastes, pesticides, household hazardous wastes, pet wastes, trash, and other contaminants that can be washed into the City's stormwater collection systems. 
	(d)	A high percentage of impervious area correlates to a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the stormwater collection system, resulting in turbid water, nutrient enrichment, bacterial contamination, toxic compounds, temperature increases, and increases of trash or debris. 
	(e)	When water quality impacts are considered during the planning stages of a project, new development and redevelopment projects can more efficiently incorporate measures to protect water quality. 
	(f)	Sections 147-147.6 protect the health, safety and general welfare of the City's residents by:
		(1)	minimizing increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality;
		(3)	controlling the discharge to the City's sewer and drainage systems from spills, dumping or disposal of pollutants; and
		(4)	reducing stormwater run-off rates, volume, and nonpoint source pollution whenever possible, through stormwater management controls, and ensuring that these management controls are safe and properly maintained.

SEC. 184.  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that newsracks placed and maintained on the streets, sidewalks, or other public rights-of-way, absent some reasonable regulation, may unreasonably interfere with the use of such streets, sidewalks, and public rights-of-way, and may present hazards to persons or property. 
	The Board of Supervisors further finds that streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way are historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and other publications, and that access to and use of these areas for such purposes is not to be denied except where such use unreasonably interferes with the use of these areas by pedestrians or traffic, or where such use presents a hazard to persons or property. 
	The Board of Supervisors therefore has determined that a reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this Article, which regulates the placement and maintenance of newsracks.

SEC. 184.12.  FIXED PEDESTAL NEWSRACKS.
	(a)	PURPOSE AND INTENT. The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares: 
		(1)	The City and County of San Francisco has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets, public sidewalks and public rights-of-way are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks, and that newsracks are properly maintained. 
		(2)	In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on City streets, and particularly poorly maintained or abandoned freestanding newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of public sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, interfered with the use of streets, public sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property, contributed to the litter problems of public sidewalks, and resulted in visual blight. 
		(3)	The City and County of San Francisco has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities identified in Sections I.5.24 through I.5.25, I.5.32 through I.5.33, and II.4.2 of the San Francisco General Plan. To that end, and consistent with the Downtown Area Plan of the General Plan (§§ II.1.48 through II.1.50), the City must take steps to reduce the visual blight, the inconvenience and the hazards associated with unlimited numbers and designs of newsracks, poorly maintained newsracks and the virtually unrestricted placement of newsracks on public streets, public sidewalks and public rights-of-way. 
		(4)	A six-month pilot program employing fixed pedestal newsracks at various locations the City has shown that an effective way to reduce the visual clutter and hazards associated with excessive numbers of newsracks is to prohibit freestanding newsracks in congested areas, and to allow only fixed pedestal newsracks in these areas. 
		(5)	The purpose of this section is to promote the public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the City by controlling the placement, size, construction and appearance of newsracks and fixed pedestal units so as to accomplish the following, to the extent reasonably possible in compliance with this section and the guidelines: 
			(A)	Provide for pedestrian and vehicular safety and convenience;
			(B)	Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into, or egress from, any residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles; 
			(C)	Ensure compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly located newsracks; 
			(D)	Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, police or fire call boxes, sidewalk elevators, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb ramps, parking meters, and locations used for public transportation services; 
			(E)	Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained, improperly located or abandoned newsracks;
			(F)	Protect the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the City;
			(G)	Advance the economic interests of the City's businesses and residents, including the interests of those involved in the publication or distribution of newspapers and news periodicals through newsracks; 
			(H)	Respect publications' interests in effective distribution, including by (i) allowing publications currently distributed from freestanding newsracks to receive distribution space in fixed pedestal units located at, or as close as reasonably possible to, the locations of such freestanding newsracks; (ii) allowing publications not currently distributed from freestanding newsracks to receive distribution space in fixed pedestal units, (iii) allowing the number, locations, and usage of fixed pedestal units to change over time in response to changing market conditions; and (iv) specifying reasonable conditions under which paid publications shall have the right to repair, maintain, replace or otherwise engage in self-help as to specific components of newsrack boxes they occupy that relate to newsrack box functionality; 
			(I)	Provide for streetworthy fixed pedestal units and prompt and effective maintenance, repair and replacement of such units, including by providing for expeditious maintenance, repair and replacement of parts of such units which, if not thus maintained, repaired or replaced, could significantly impede the effective use of such units for the sales or distribution of publications; and 
			(J)	Specify reasonable conditions under which paid publications may elect to have the Vendor assume responsibility for repair, maintenance, or replacement of coin mechanisms and related parts of newsrack boxes that those paid publications occupy, and may subsequently revoke such election. 
		(6)	In adopting this section, the Board of Supervisors is mindful that regulation of newsracks implicates rights protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and by Article I, Section 2 of the California Constitution. To that end, the Board of Supervisors directs the Director of the Department of Public Works, the General Manager of the Municipal Railway, and other appropriate City officials to interpret and apply this section and the guidelines promulgated under this section, and to exercise their powers and duties, in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of citizens and the regulated community. 
		(7)	Use of streets, public sidewalks and other public rights-of-way for distribution of newspapers may be denied where such use presents a danger to persons or property. Use of these areas for such purposes may be restricted where it unreasonably interferes with the intended use of the area or with pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or results in unreasonable levels of visual blight. 
		(8)	In recent years, City officials have noticed that a number of newsracks in the City are placed in inappropriate locations, are abandoned, or are poorly maintained. Many of these newsracks also end up being used as trash receptacles, causing unsightly and unsanitary clutter and litter. 
		(9)	Given the limited space available and the increasing congestion on certain public sidewalks, streets and public rights-of-way, the City has a substantial interest in devising an approach to placement of newsracks and fixed pedestal units in those areas that promote public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic quality of the City. This objective may be achieved by creating "fixed pedestal zones" in highly congested areas or areas that have particular public safety, aesthetic, historical, or economic concerns. Allowing fixed pedestal units and prohibiting freestanding newsracks and unauthorized fixed pedestal units in these zones will promote the City's interest in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the City, and advancing the economic interests of the City's businesses and residents by improving the appearance of the area and resulting in better use of space and reduced congestion, while respecting publication's interests in effective distribution. A reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this section, which regulates the placement, size, construction design, maintenance, and appearance of newsracks and fixed pedestal units in specified areas. 
		(10)	This section is not intended to and does not ban freestanding newsracks on public sidewalks, streets and public rights-of-way throughout the City. Subject to Section 184.12(c) and the guidelines, freestanding newsracks may continue to be placed on public sidewalks, streets and public rights-of-way in areas of the City that are not within fixed pedestal zones created pursuant to this section, in accordance with Article 5.4, Sections 184 through 184.11, of the San Francisco Public Works Code and the guidelines promulgated thereunder. Publications also may continue to be distributed within fixed pedestal zones created pursuant to this section by all authorized means other than freestanding newsracks. 
	(b)	DEFINITIONS. The definitions contained in Section 184.1 shall apply to this section except to the extent such definitions are inconsistent with the following: 
		(1)	"Abandoned newsrack box" means any newsrack box that either remains empty for more than fifteen (15) business days or contains only outdated issues in violation of the guidelines promulgated under this section, after the expiration of applicable notice, grace and cure periods. In case of a labor strike or a temporary and extraordinary interruption of distribution or publication of the newspaper or other periodical sold or dispensed from that newsrack box, the publication shall notify the Director in writing in order to avoid having the newsrack box deemed abandoned. 
		(2)	A "block face" means the sidewalk between, and including, two contiguous curb corners without an intervening street or other roadway, excluding driveways. 
		(3)	A "curb corner" means the common area formed at the intersection of, and consisting of the overlap of, two adjacent sidewalks.
		(4)	A "cluster of fixed pedestal units" means two or more fixed pedestal units located such that each unit is within twenty-five feet (25') of another unit on the same block face. 
		(5)	"Director" means the Director of the Department of Public Works or his or her designated agent or representative.
		(6)	"Fixed pedestal zone" means any area designated by the Director, in accordance with this section and the guidelines in which distribution of newspapers through newsracks is restricted to fixed pedestal units installed in a style and manner approved by the Director. 
		(7)	"Fixed pedestal permit" means a permit issued to a publication authorizing the placement of the publication in one or more newsrack boxes in a fixed pedestal unit in a Fixed Pedestal Zone. 
		(8)	"Fixed pedestal unit" means an assembly which is of a type, design or model approved by the Director and which contains one or more self-service or coin-operated boxes, containers, storage units or other dispensers installed, used or maintained for the display and sale or free distribution of publications, and which is attached to the public sidewalk, street or public right-of-way in accordance with this section, guidelines promulgated under this section, and any vendor contract. 
		(9)	"Freestanding newsrack" means any self-service or coin-operated box, container, storage unit or other dispenser installed, used or maintained for the display and sale or the distribution without charge of publications, and which is not a fixed pedestal unit authorized under this section. 
		(10)	A "historically present" publication means a publication that, according to the survey completed most recently before initial implementation of this section in any fixed pedestal zone, was distributed from at least one freestanding newsrack situated cat the area in question. For purposes of the preceding sentence: 
			(A)	"Area" means either a corner area or a midblock area. A "corner area" is that general portion of a block face that, as reasonably estimated by the Director in the compilation of the survey without undertaking actual measurement, is no more than thirty-five feet (35') from the edge of the nearest curb corner on that block face, or, if there is one or more item of street furniture, utilities, or other fixed obstructions (except freestanding newsracks) within those thirty-five feet (35'), no more than fifty feet (50') from the edge of the nearest curb corner. A midblock area is that general portion of a block face that is not a corner area under this subsection. 
			(B)	Because freestanding newsracks are often inadvertently moved into locations that are illegal under City laws or regulations, a freestanding newsrack is "situated" in the area in question even if it is placed in a location that violates one or more City laws or regulations concerning freestanding newsrack placement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no freestanding newsrack shall support a claim of historical presence, or be counted in any survey of historically present freestanding newsracks, if it is secured to a tree, tree grate, or tree guard; is secured to or interfering with a fire hydrant, police or fire call box, or parking meter; or is located in a crosswalk, in any part of a bus zone save the last fifteen feet (15') thereof, in a blue zone, in any location where it interferes with a handicapped access ramp, or in any other location where it poses a similar significant threat to public safety or property. 
		(11)	"Initial implementation" means the first stage of implementation of this section throughout a fixed pedestal zone, and shall include the selection of locations for initial fixed pedestal units in that zone which are as close as possible to the former locations of freestanding newsracks, in compliance with this section and the guidelines; the allocation of space within those units to historically present publications and, if possible, to other interested publications; and the installation of those units. 
		(12)	"Newsrack" means a freestanding newsrack or an unauthorized fixed pedestal unit.
		(13)	"Newsrack box" shall mean the individual space within a fixed pedestal unit that dispenses one publication, including the door, coin return mechanism and associated hardware. Except as stated otherwise in this section or the guidelines, if the vendor has split a newsrack box into two separate distribution areas, each such area shall constitute a separate newsrack box. "Newsrack box" does not include any freestanding newsrack. 
		(14)	"Permit holder" means a publication that has been issued one or more fixed pedestal permits by the Director, or that is otherwise authorized to occupy one or more newsrack boxes. 
		(15)	A "petition unit" means a fixed pedestal unit installed pursuant to a petition under subsection 184.12(g)(3)(B) after initial implementation has occurred throughout the fixed pedestal zone in question. 
		(16)	"Publication" includes all editions of that publication, including but not limited to morning, evening, or special editions, as well as any editions of that publication published jointly with another publisher. 
		(17)	"Public right-of-way" means land which by deed, conveyance, agreement, easement, dedication, usage or process of law is reserved and dedicated to the general public for street, highway, alley, public utility, or pedestrian walkway purposes, whether or not said land has been improved or accepted for maintenance by the City. 
		(18)	"Roadway" means that portion of a public street that is improved or customarily used for vehicular traffic.
		(19)	"Section" or "this section," or "any subsection thereof" means Article 5.4, Section 184.12 of the San Francisco Public Works Code. 
		(20)	"Sidewalk" means any public surface or public walkway provided for the exclusive or primary use of pedestrians.
		(21)	"Street" means all that area dedicated to the public use, including but not limited to roadways, sidewalks and planter strips.
		(22)	A "survey" means a written enumeration of the freestanding newsracks situated on public sidewalks and public rights-of-way in one or more portions of the City that (A) states the name of the publication distributed from each such freestanding newsrack, with such names listed according to survey order; (B) states whether each such freestanding newsrack is situated at a corner area or midblock area, as reasonably estimated by the Director without undertaking actual measurement; (C) is conducted after the effective date of this Section; and (D) is accompanied by a contemporaneous videotape or comparable photographic depiction of such freestanding newsracks that the Director retains for at least twelve (12) months cater initial implementation in that zone is completed. For purposes of the preceding sentence "area" and "situated" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 184.12(b)(10). 
		(23)	"Survey order" means that the Director, in conducting a survey of freestanding newsracks situated in a particular area, as defined in Section 184.12(b)(10), shall proceed in the following order: 
			(A)	In surveying a corner area, the Director shall:
				(i)	First survey that group of freestanding newsracks in that area that is located on the curb side of the sidewalk (as opposed to the property line side of the sidewalk) and is located closest to the corner. Within that group, the Director shall first survey those freestanding newsracks that face toward the property line, starting with those closest to the corner, and shall then survey those freestanding newsracks that do not face toward the property line, starting with those closest to the corner; 
				(ii)	Then repeat the process described in subsection (i) immediately above for each other group of freestanding newsracks in that area that also is located on the curb side of the sidewalk, proceeding from group to group in order of increasing distance from the corner, until all groups of freestanding newsracks in that area that are located on the curb side of the sidewalk have been surveyed; 
				(iii)	Then repeat the process described in subsection (i) for each remaining group of freestanding newsracks located in that area (i.e. freestanding newsracks not on the curb side of the sidewalk), proceeding from group to group in order of increasing distance from the corner, until all groups of freestanding newsracks in that area have been surveyed. 
			(B)	In surveying a midblock area, the Director shall:
				(i)	First survey that group of freestanding newsracks in that area that is located on the curb side of the sidewalk and that a vehicle moving on that side of the street would first encounter. Within that group, the Director shall first survey those freestanding newsracks that face toward the property line, proceeding from newsrack to newsrack in the direction in which vehicular traffic on that side of the street moves, and shall then survey those freestanding newsracks that do not face toward the property line, again proceeding from newsrack to newsrack in the direction in which vehicular traffic on that side of the street moves; 
				(ii)	Then repeat the process described in subsection (i) immediately above for each other group of freestanding newsracks in that area that also is located on the curb side of the sidewalk, proceeding from group to group in the direction in which vehicular traffic on that side of the street moves, until all groups of freestanding newsracks in that area that are located on the curb side of the sidewalk have been surveyed; 
				(iii)	Then repeat the process described in subsection (i) for each remaining group of freestanding newsracks located in that area, proceeding from group to group in the direction in which vehicular traffic on that side of the street moves, until all groups of freestanding newsracks in that area have been surveyed. 
		(24)	"Unauthorized fixed pedestal unit" means an assembly containing one or more self-service or coin-operated boxes, containers, storage units or other dispensers installed, used or maintained for the display and sale or free distribution of publications, and which is attached to the public sidewalk, street or public right-of-way in a fixed pedestal zone, which is not authorized pursuant to a vendor contract. 
		(25)	"Vendor" means any individual or entity that has entered into an agreement with the Director, or any agent thereof, to provide, install and maintain fixed pedestal units pursuant to this section. 
		(26)	"Vendor contract" means any agreement between the Director and a vendor pursuant subsection 184.12(d)(3).
	(c)	SCOPE. The requirements this section shall apply to all fixed pedestal units, unauthorized fixed pedestal units, newsrack boxes and freestanding newsracks located within fixed pedestal zones designated by the Director in accordance with subsection 184.12(f) or within fifteen feet (15) of any fixed pedestal unit that is located in such a zone. To the extent any provision in Sections 184 through 184.11 is in conflict or inconsistent with this section, it is the Board of Supervisors' intention that this section shall control in any fixed pedestal zone or within fifteen feet (15) of any fixed pedestal unit that is located in such a zone. 
	(d)	GUIDELINES, FEES, AND AUTHORITY OF DIRECTOR.
		(1)	Promulgation of Guidelines.
			(A)	The Director is hereby authorized and directed to promptly promulgate guidelines consistent with the provisions of this section controlling the selection of locations for, as well as the placement, size, construction, design, methods of attachment, appearance, and maintenance and repair of fixed pedestal units and newsrack boxes in fixed pedestal zones. The guidelines shall also contain procedures for establishing or amending fixed pedestal zones, for determining access by publications to fixed pedestal units, and for obtaining fixed pedestal permits. The guidelines may also set maximum density levels for fixed pedestal units in fixed pedestal zones, including different levels for commercial and residential areas of the City. 
			(B)	In promulgating guidelines, the Director's decisions shall be consistent with the purpose of this section, as set forth in subsection 184.12(a)(5)(A)-(J). 
			(C)	The guidelines shall be adopted by way of a Department of Public Works order signed by the Director after giving due consideration to the recommendations of the Newsrack Advisory Committee. The provisions of this section governing fixed pedestal units, access to fixed pedestal units by publications, and prohibiting freestanding newsracks and unauthorized fixed pedestal units in fixed pedestal zones shall not be implemented or enforced until the guidelines specified in this paragraph are in effect and notice of the effective date has been published in the City's official newspaper. 
		(2)	Procedures or Adopting or Amending Guidelines.

The Director is hereby authorized to select and enter into an agreement with a vendor or vendors to provide for the installation and maintenance of fixed pedestal units in accordance with this section. Any such agreement shall include, in addition to any other provisions required by applicable City laws or by guidelines adopted by the Director pursuant to subparagraph (1), the following requirements: 
			(A)	The vendor shall provide for streetworthy fixed pedestal units, and shall be responsible for installing and promptly and effectively maintaining the condition and appearance of, and repairing and replacing, all fixed pedestal units and newsrack boxes subject to the agreement (except for responsibilities which are the obligation of the permit holder pursuant to subsection 184.12(i) in accordance with the terms of the agreement and the requirements of this section; 
			(B)	The vendor shall provide a way to disable and render inoperative any newsrack box that is found by the Director to be in violation of this section by means such as a locking plate over the offending newsrack box. The vendor(s) shall agree to disable any such newsrack boxes within 24 hours of receiving notice to do so from the Director; 
			(C)	A statement to accordance with Section 6.63-1 of the San Francisco Administrative Code that the vendor has a clear and unequivocal understanding that a possessory interest subject to taxation may be created by the agreement and the vendor shall pay any and all possessory interest taxes levied upon the vendor's interest therein pursuant to an assessment lawfully made by the Assessor; 
			(D)	The vendor shall furnish evidence of insurance that is satisfactory to the City Risk Manager, and that names the City as an additional insured; 
			(E)	The vendor shall have no authority to make determinations concerning where fixed pedestal units will be located, or concerning which publications shall have access to a fixed pedestal unit; 
			(F)	Where the Director intends to allow the vendor to place advertising on the back of one or more fixed pedestal units authorized under this section, the agreement shall set forth the requirements applicable to such advertising, including the requirements set forth in subsection 184.12(i)(1)(F); 
			(G)	The vendor shall provide a reasonable opportunity for paid publications to elect to have the vendor assume responsibility for repair, maintenance, or replacement of coin mechanisms and related parts of newsrack boxes that those paid publications occupy, and to subsequently revoke such an election; 
			(H)	The vendor shall specify reasonable conditions under which publications shall have the right to repair, maintain, replace or otherwise engage in self-help as to specific components of newsrack boxes they occupy, and to obtain reimbursement for certain repair, maintenance, or replacement; 
			(I)	The vendor shall provide for installation of reasonable security features to protect the integrity of the fixed pedestal units, including any coin mechanisms and associated hardware; 
			(J)	The vendor shall allow paid publications, at their own cost, to change the coin mechanism in newsrack boxes they occupy, subject to reasonable notice and procedures, to adapt to changing technology and advances; 
			(K)	The vendor shall maintain and display a "hotline" telephone number on the fixed pedestal units authorized by the vendor contract;
			(L)	The vendor shall reasonably retain information as to complaints concerning and repairs to each newsrack box in each fixed pedestal unit authorized by the vendor contract and make such information available, reasonably promptly, to the publication occupying each such newsrack box and to the Director; 
			(M)	The vendor shall provide a way to split newsrack boxes into two separate distribution areas for the distribution of publications that are distributed free of charge; and 
			(N)	The vendor shall be responsible for the installation, repair and replacement of price plates, if any, including installation, repair and replacement necessitated by a change in the price of a publication. 
			(O)	The current provisions of the "First Amended and Restated Pedestal-Mounted Newsrack Agreement By and Between the City and County of San Francisco and Clear Channel Adshel, Inc." satisfy the current requirements of this section concerning vendor contracts, as of the date of the City's approval and authorization of said agreement, including the requirements listed at Section 184.12(d)(3)(A)-(N), above. In the event of any disagreement, interpretive issue, ambiguity, or silence in respect to the tens of this section and said agreement, said agreement, except as to any amendment, modification or supplement to either or both the agreement or this section, shall control the rights and obligations of the Vendor under said agreement, whose fulfillment of the current provisions of said agreement shall constitute compliance with this section. 
		(4)	Content-Based Discrimination Prohibited. The Director shall not consider the content or viewpoint of the material to be distributed through fixed pedestal units in administering or enforcing this section, or in adopting or implementing guidelines pursuant to this section. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Director to require blinder racks for adult-oriented publications in accordance with subsection 184.12(i). 
		(5)	Newsrack Advisory Committee. The Director is hereby authorized and directed to establish a Newsrack Advisory Committee consisting of 11 members. The Newsrack Program Manager of the Department of Public Works shall be a voting member, and shall chair the Committee. The Director shall appoint to the Committee persons drawn from, or having expertise in, the newspaper, news and/or commercial periodical, and distributing industries in the City, and/or drawn from neighborhood and merchant groups, and other interested members of the public. The number of Committee members who are representatives of publishers and/or distributors shall equal the number of Committee members who are representatives of neighborhood and/or merchant groups. The Director shall endeavor to include on the Committee representatives paid and unpaid publications and of more and less frequently published publications. The Committee shall advise the Director in the implementation and administration of this section; resolve disputes concerning the locations of fixed pedestal units, to the extent consistent with this section and the guidelines; and minimize the cost to the City of the implementation and administration of this section. No vendor or agent or employee of a vendor may serve on the Committee. Committee members shall serve at the pleasure of the Director for a term of one year, and may be reappointed to additional terms. The Committee shall hold regularly scheduled meetings, with notice posted in the City's official newspaper. 
		(6)	Fees.
			(A)	The Director is hereby authorized and directed to establish and collect an annual permit fee to be paid by each permit holder. This fee is established at $50 for each newsrack box, including each split newsrack box. The Director has determined that the anticipated annual revenue from this fee within any particular year shall not exceed the actual costs incurred by the Director for implementation, administration and enforcement of the program during that year. The fee shall only be used to cover such costs, and not as a revenue-generating source for the City. The fee adopted pursuant to this provision shall be nonrefundable, and shall be uniformly imposed upon all permit holders based upon the number of newsrack boxes authorized for each permit holder. The fee shall not exceed the pro-rata share allocated to each newsrack box of the actual costs incurred in implementing, administering, and enforcing the program established under this section. 
			(B)	The fee shall be reviewed annually by the Director, who shall propose to the Board of Supervisors any recommended adjustments, along with written justification for the adjustment and any necessary legislation. In any year where the Director anticipates that the revenue from fees will exceed the estimated administrative costs, less penalties, during that year, the Director shall recommend an adjustment reducing the fee. Where the proceeds from the fee are less than the estimated costs of program administration, less penalties, the Director may recommend an adjustment. In proposing adjustments, the Director shall take into account the anticipated penalties and other charges to be collected from violators during the forthcoming year. These proceeds shall be used to offset program administration and enforcement costs that would otherwise be defrayed by fees imposed during the forthcoming year so that the fees, including any surplus from the prior year, do not exceed the projected actual costs of administering the program. For any year in which the fee proceeds exceed actual administration, inspection and abatement expenses, such surplus shall be taken into account in fixing the fee for the subsequent year. 
	(e)	PERMIT REQUIREMENT.
		(1)	Fixed Pedestal Permit. Permits are necessary to facilitate the regulation and inspection of newsrack boxes for the purposes set forth in this section. Except where this section or the guidelines expressly provide otherwise, no person may place any publication in any newsrack box in a fixed pedestal unit on a public sidewalk, street or public right-of-way in a fixed pedestal zone for the purpose of sale or distribution without having first obtained from the Director a fixed pedestal permit authorizing placement of the publication in that newsrack box. 
		(2)	Duty to Obtain Permit. Except where this section or the guidelines expressly provide otherwise, each publication seeking access to a newsrack box or boxes in a fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal units shall apply to the City or a fixed pedestal permit for each newsrack box in each fixed pedestal unit to which the publication seeks access. The permit holder shall be responsible for the payment of all fees or penalties due or imposed under this section with respect to that permit holder's newsrack box(es). Once a permit has been granted pursuant to this section and the requirements of the guidelines, and if the permit has not subsequently been revoked, the permit holder shall not be required to renew or reapply for another fixed pedestal permit for the same newsrack box. 
		(3)	Application. Application for a fixed pedestal permit shall be made in writing on a form and in a manner provided by the City and filed with the Director or by other medium approved by the Director. The application package shall inform the applicant of the requirements of this section and the guidelines promulgated under this section. 
		(4)	Permit Issuance.
			(A)	The Director shall grant or deny a properly completed and timely application for a fixed pedestal permit from a publication, or from the agent for a publication, accompanied by written authorization from the publication, as specified in the guidelines, within fifteen (15) business days of the Director's receipt of the application. However, if the Director has not completed the application of the space allocation procedures set forth in subsection 184.12(h) and the guidelines, the Director shall have an additional five (5) business days to grant or deny the application. 
			(B)	The Director shall issue the fixed pedestal permit unless the Director finds one or more of the following grounds for denial to exist, in which case the Director shall deny the application for a permit. The grounds for denial of an application for a fixed pedestal permit are: (i) the application is incomplete; (ii) the application was not submitted on time; (iii) space in the newsrack box that is the subject of the application is not available after application of the space allocation procedures set forth in subsection 184.12(h) and the guidelines; or (iv) the publication that applied for the permit has failed to pay any outstanding administrative penalties levied against it pursuant to subsection 184.12(k)(1)(A). If an application is denied, the Director shall notify the applicant promptly in writing, explaining the reasons for the denial, and citing the relevant portions of this subsection and the guidelines. 
		(5)	Violations. Failure to comply with any requirement of this section, or any requirement of the guidelines authorized by this section, shall constitute a violation of this section. Any such violation may be cause for removal of the offending freestanding newsrack or unauthorized fixed pedestal unit, or disabling of the offending newsrack box pursuant to subsection 184.12(j), and for the imposition of administrative penalties pursuant to subsection 184.12(k). 
		(6)	Permit Revocation.
			(A)	The Board of Supervisors specifically determines that any fixed pedestal permit issued pursuant to this section confers a non-transferable, revocable privilege upon the permit holder. Where one or more of the grounds for revocation specified in subparagraph (B) exist, the Director shall promptly initiate such revocation in order to ensure that space in the fixed pedestal unit is made available to another publication that will lawfully use it, including publications that did not receive such space during initial implementation in the fixed pedestal zone in which the fixed pedestal unit in question is located. Any such permit may be revoked by the Director fifteen (15) business days after the Director provides written notice to the permit holder that one or more of the grounds for revocation specified in subparagraph (B) exist, if the permit holder does not correct all of the violations on or before the close of the fifteenth (15th) business day. If the permit is revoked, the Director shall notify the permit holder promptly in writing, explaining the reasons or the revocation, and citing the relevant portions of this subsection and the guidelines. 
			(B)	The grounds for revocation of a fixed pedestal permit are: (i) the permit holder did not submit the required permit fee, as specified in the guidelines, within ten (10) business days of the Director's approval of the voluntary space allocation agreement or of the space allocation meeting at which the permit holder was allocated the newsrack box that is the subject of the permit; (ii) the permit holder did not submit the required annual fee on time; (iii) the newsrack box that is the subject of the permit has been vacated pursuant to subsection 184.12(j)(3)(D); (iv) the newsrack box that is the subject of the permit has been abandoned pursuant to subsection 184.12(b)(1); or (v) the Director's decision to grant the permit was successfully challenged by a person aggrieved by the determination pursuant to subsection 184.12(m) and the guidelines. In addition, the Board of Supervisors may at any time in its exclusive legislative discretion elect to repeal or amend this section and thereby render null and void any permits issued pursuant this section. 
	(f)	ESTABLISHMENT OF FIXED PEDESTAL ZONES.
		(1)	Fixed Pedestal Units Restricted. No person shall place, operate or maintain a fixed pedestal unit on any public street, public sidewalk or public right-of-way located in a fixed pedestal zone except in accordance with a vendor contract. Any unauthorized fixed pedestal unit which in whole or in part is attached to or rests upon a public street, public sidewalk or public right-of-way located in a fixed pedestal zone shall be subject to impoundment pursuant to subsection 184.12(j). The owner of any unauthorized fixed pedestal unit properly impounded by the Director under subsection 184.12(j) shall be responsible for restoring the sidewalk to its original condition by replacing the concrete or other material in accordance with Section 703.2 of the Public Works Code. 
		(2)	Freestanding Newsracks Prohibited. No person shall place, operate or maintain a freestanding newsrack on any public street, public sidewalk or public right-of-way located in fixed pedestal zone, or located within fifteen feet (15') of any fixed pedestal unit that is located in a fixed pedestal zone. Any freestanding newsrack which in whole or in part or rests upon a public street, sidewalk or right-of-way located in a fixed pedestal zone, or located within fifteen feet (15') of any fixed pedestal unit that is located in a fixed pedestal zone, shall be subject to impoundment pursuant to subsection 184.12(j). 
		(3)	Fixed Pedestal Zones.
			(A)	The Director is authorized to establish one or more fixed pedestal zones within the City subject to the following requirements:
				(i)	The Director shall determine the location of fixed pedestal zones in compliance with, and consistent with the purpose and intent of, this section and the guidelines. Subject to subsection 184.12(f)(3)(A)(iii), such zones generally shall be established only in areas of the City which have one or more of the following: extensive public transit service, usage, and/or facilities; large concentrations of freestanding newsracks; or large numbers of pedestrians. 
				(ii)	The Director shall not establish a fixed pedestal zone in any area of the City unless, within the immediately preceding twenty-four (24) months, the Director has completed a survey of that area and made that survey publicly available reasonably promptly upon its completion, and no later than the establishment of the fixed pedestal zone. Each such survey shall be completed reasonably promptly after it is begun. 
				(iii)	Where a fixed pedestal zone would not otherwise contain sufficient space to install fixed pedestal units sufficient to accommodate those publications which the survey shows to be historically present in that zone, in accordance with this section and the guidelines, the Director shall establish or amend the zone to include adjoining portions of intersecting side streets, or adjacent portions of the street on which the zone was established (including where the zone was established only on one side of a street, portions of the other side of that street), as necessary to increase the space available in the zone for fixed pedestal units to accommodate such publications, if reasonably possible. 
				(iv)	Except as this section or the guidelines provide otherwise, the Director shall establish fixed pedestal zones following consultation with the Newsrack Advisory Committee. Each zone shall be deemed established as of the date the Director publishes notice of the zone's location in the City's official newspaper following such consultation. 
			(B)	Subject to the requirements of this section, the guidelines, and any vendor contract, initial implementation of this section within each fixed pedestal zone shall begin promptly after the Director establishes that zone. All aspects of initial implementation that require information contained in a survey, including the selection of fixed pedestal unit locations or the initial allocation of space in fixed pedestal units to historically present publications, shall only occur on the basis of a survey that was completed no more than twenty-four (24) months earlier. 
			(C)	Not later than twelve (12) months after the Director first implements this section pursuant to subsection 184.12(l), and at least once every two (2) years thereafter, the Director shall issue a report in writing to the Board of Supervisors. This report shall address the implementation of this section, inform the Board of the effectiveness of the existing Fixed Pedestal Zones, and make any recommendations and include proposed legislation regarding changes that the Director believes are necessary, including, without limitation, any changes believed necessary to ensure that publications that did not receive space in fixed pedestal units in initial implementation are subsequently able to receive such space. 
	(g)	LOCATIONS AND PLACEMENT OF FIXED PEDESTAL UNITS.
		(1)	General.
			(A)	All fixed pedestal units within a designated fixed pedestal zone shall be of a design designated by the Director and approved by the Art Commission pursuant to its authority under City Charter Section 5.103. The Director shall consider the factors set forth in subsection 184.12(a)(5) in selecting designs for fixed pedestal units. 
			(B)	The Director shall monitor the installation and maintenance of fixed pedestal units and newsrack boxes in fixed pedestal zones.
		(2)	Selection of Fixed Pedestal Unit Locations.
			(A)	Initial Units. During initial implementation in each fixed pedestal zone, the locations of fixed pedestal units in that zone shall be selected, so that to the extent reasonably possible and in compliance with this section and the guidelines, (i) publications that are historically present at corner areas (as defined in Section 184.12(b)(10)) may receive space in fixed pedestal units located in that zone as close as reasonably possible to, and no more than seven feet (7') from, the curb corner, excluding space taken up by intervening street furniture; (ii) publications that are historically present at midblock areas (as defined in Section 184.12(b)(10)) may receive space in fixed pedestal units in that zone located as close as possible to the midblock locations of their former freestanding newsracks; and (iii) the number of newsrack boxes at each fixed pedestal unit location equals the number of freestanding newsracks historically present at each such location. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, initial implementation, including the selection (fixed pedestal unit locations, in a fixed pedestal zone may occur even if the objectives stated subsections (i), (ii), and/or (iii) of the foregoing sentence cannot be wholly achieved, in which case those objectives will be achieved to the extent reasonably possible consistent with this section and the guidelines. Initial fixed pedestal unit locations shall be selected in accordance with the requirements of the guidelines and with the following requirements: 
				(i)	Each publication shall have a reasonable opportunity to submit a proposal (a "plan") to the Director proposing fixed pedestal units at locations situated pursuant to Section 184.12(g)(2)(A), at which the publication is historically present within the fixed pedestal zone, according to the survey. If at least three-quarters (¾) of the publications that are historically present at a location in the survey do not collectively submit a single plan concerning that location, the Director may select a location or locations for fixed pedestal units to replace the freestanding newsracks at that location in accordance with Section 184.12(g)(2)(A). Any plan submitted by any publication(s) may include one or more proposed locations. 
				(ii)	The Director may amend or reject all or part of a plan submitted by at least three-quarters (¾) of the publications that are historically present at a particular survey location only if the plan fails to comply with this Section and the guidelines. If the Director amends or rejects all or part of such a plan, he shall explain the basis for the amendment or rejection in writing, citing the portions of this Section and/or the guidelines upon which he relies, and shall afford those publications a reasonable opportunity to revise their plan to address the grounds for such amendment or rejection. If those publications do not do so, the Director may determine the locations of fixed pedestal units as to which he amended or rejected the publishers' plan provided such determination is in compliance with this Section and the guidelines. 
				(iii)	If at least three-quarters (¾) of the publications that are historically present at a particular survey location revise their plan to address the grounds for the Director's amendment or rejection thereof within a reasonable time, and those publications and the Director cannot agree on locations for fixed pedestal units in the zone following such revisions, the locations in dispute may be resolved by the Newsrack Advisory Committee in accordance with all requirements of this section, the guidelines, and the vendor contract, if and only if the Director receives a request for such Newsrack Advisory Committee review submitted by at least three-quarters (¾) of the publications that are historically present at the survey location in dispute. The Committee's determination (or, if the Committee fails to promptly decide, the Director's most recent determination) shall constitute the City's final administrative determination. Any party may bring a court reporter to any such Committee meeting and record a transcript of the meeting. 
			(B)	Petition Units. After initial implementation within a fixed pedestal zone has been completed, any publication may submit a petition to the Director requesting the installation of an additional fixed pedestal unit be installed at a location specified in the petition. Other interested publications may submit a proposal for the location of the petition unit to the Director. If the Director receives a proposal for the location of the petition unit from at least three-quarters (¾) of the interested publications (including the petitioner) that complies with this section and the guidelines, the location set forth in such proposal shall be the proposed location or purposes of locating the petition unit. If the Director does not receive such a proposal, the location proposed in the petition shall be the proposed location for purposes of locating the petition unit. The location of each petition unit shall be determined in accordance with procedures contained in the guidelines. If the location as thereby determined is consistent with the requirements of this section and the guidelines, the Director shall authorize the installation of the fixed pedestal unit at the specified location. The Director shall deny any petition under this paragraph that would violate the maximum density levels set forth in the guidelines, or that would cause the total number of fixed pedestal units to exceed the number of fixed pedestal units available under any vendor contract. The Director also shall deny any petition that seeks the installation of one or more fixed pedestal units at an intersection at which, within the twelve months preceding the petition, a consolidation of fixed pedestal units has taken place pursuant to Section 184.12(g)(2)(E). However, the Director shall not deny any petition that complies with Section 184.12 and the guidelines on the ground that one or more fixed pedestal units are being held in reserve. 
			(C)	Relocated Units. In the event that the vendor initiates relocation of any fixed pedestal unit due to excessive repair costs pursuant to the vendor contract, the Director shall promptly select the location to which the unit shall be relocated and reconfigure the fixed pedestal zone to exclude the area from which the fixed pedestal unit is being relocated, as set forth in the guidelines. The Director shall maintain a list of potential locations for such purpose. 
			(D)	Reserve Units. To accommodate the installation of additional fixed pedestal units after initial implementation, and to respond to changing conditions and publications that may seek distribution space in fixed pedestal units in the future, the Director shall make reasonable efforts to implement this section in a manner that maintains some of the fixed pedestal units authorized under a vendor contract in reserve. Such reserve shall be numerous enough to allow the maximum number of fixed pedestal units that can be installed in existing fixed pedestal zones in compliance with this section and the guidelines, to be installed in those zones. No request, petition, or plan for a fixed pedestal unit that complies with this Section and the guidelines shall be denied on the ground that one or more fixed pedestal units are being held in reserve. 
			(E)	Consolidation. If newsrack boxes in fixed pedestal units located at a particular intersection have been abandoned or have otherwise become available for reallocation, and the Director has made reasonable efforts to reallocate such newsrack boxes but notwithstanding such efforts newsrack boxes in such fixed pedestal units remain un-allocated, the Director may consolidate the fixed pedestal units located at that intersection by removing one or more of those units at that intersection. Any such consolidation shall comply with the following requirements: 
				(i)	Consolidation shall occur only if the fixed pedestal unit(s) to be located at that intersection after consolidation will provide distribution space sufficient to allow each publication that was being distributed from one or more fixed pedestal unit(s) at that intersection immediately before consolidation (an "affected publication") to still be distributed from the same number of newsrack boxes at that intersection after consolidation as it was distributed from before consolidation; 
				(ii)	The Director shall notify the affected publications, in writing, of his intent to consolidate the fixed pedestal units at that intersection, and of the number of units to be removed as part of the consolidation; 
				(iii)	The affected publications shall have thirty (30) days to provide the Director with a written proposal, agreed to by at least 75% of the affected publications, as to which of the fixed pedestal units located at that intersection shall be removed to accomplish the removal of the number of units the Director intends; 
				(iv)	If such a written proposal is timely submitted and is consistent with the requirements of this Section 184.12 and the guidelines, the Director shall accept the proposal; 
				(v)	If no such written proposal is timely submitted that is consistent with the requirements of this Section 184.12 and the guidelines, the Director shall accomplish the intended number of removals by selecting for removal those fixed pedestal unit(s) at that intersection that have the highest share of their newsrack boxes unoccupied, so long as removal of such unit(s) will allow each affected publication to continue to be distributed from the same number of newsrack boxes at that intersection after consolidation as it was distributed from before consolidation; 
				(vi)	Where a fixed pedestal unit is to be removed as part of consolidation, and a publication that was distributed from a newsrack box in that unit before consolidation (a "pre-consolidation box") is, as part of the consolidation process, allocated space in a fixed pedestal unit that will remain at that intersection following consolidation (a "post-consolidation box"), that publication shall not be required to vacate the pre-consolidation box before the post-consolidation box is made available for its use. The publication also shall not be required to pay an additional fixed pedestal permit fee to occupy the post-consolidation box during the year for which it already paid a fixed pedestal permit fee to occupy the pre-consolidation box. 
			(F)	Modifying The Size Of A Fixed Pedestal Unit. If newsrack boxes in a fixed pedestal unit have been abandoned or have otherwise become available for reallocation, and the Director has made reasonable efforts to reallocate those newsrack boxes but notwithstanding such efforts newsrack boxes in the fixed pedestal unit remain un-allocated, the Director may modify the size of the fixed pedestal unit to reduce the number of newsrack boxes it contains. Any such modification in size shall comply with the following requirements: 
				(i)	The modification shall occur only if even after the modification, the fixed pedestal unit will provide distribution space sufficient to allow each publication that was being distributed from one or more newsrack boxes in the unit immediately before the modification (an "affected publication") to still be distributed from the same number of newsrack boxes in that unit after the modification; 
				(ii)	The Director shall notify the affected publications, in writing, of his intent to modify the fixed pedestal unit's size, specifying the number of newsrack boxes the unit shall contain after modification; 
				(iii)	The Director shall endeavor to ensure that notwithstanding a modification in the size of a fixed pedestal unit, affected publications remain able to be distributed from the unit as continuously as reasonably possible while the modification is in process. A publication being distributed from a fixed pedestal unit whose size has been modified shall not be required to pay an additional fixed pedestal permit fee to occupy that unit during the year for which it already paid a fixed pedestal permit fee to occupy the unit before modification. 
	(h)	ALLOCATION OF SPACE WITHIN FIXED PEDESTAL UNITS.
		(1)	General.
			(A)	Except as this section or the guidelines expressly provide otherwise, no publication that has obtained a space in a fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal units may receive a second space in that unit or cluster until all other publications that have applied for space in that unit or cluster of units have had the opportunity to select a space. 
			(B)	Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section, (i) no publication may receive more than one newsrack box per fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal units on the basis of historical presence, and (ii) a publication's use of more than one freestanding newsrack at a particular area prior to initial implementation shall not be a ground for that publication to receive more than one newsrack box on the basis of historical presence. 
		(2)	Initial Implementation. During initial implementation throughout a fixed pedestal zone, space in each fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal units in that zone shall be allocated as follows: 
			(A)	If possible, publications that have applied for space in such a unit or cluster shall agree unanimously among themselves with respect to allocation of space in the fixed pedestal unit(s). 
			(B)	Absent such agreement, the Director shall allocate space in the unit or cluster among publications that have applied for such space as follows: 
				(i)	First priority shall be given to publications that were historically present in the area (as defined in Section 184.12(b)(10)) in which were located the freestanding newsracks that the fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal units is intended to replace. 
				(ii)	Second priority, in the case of fixed pedestal units) that are located at a corner area (as defined in Section 184.12(b)(10)), shall be given to those publications that were historically present in the immediately adjacent midblock area. Second priority, in the case of fixed pedestal unit(s) that are located at a midblock area (as defined in Section 184.12(b)(10)), shall be given to those publications that were historically present in the immediately adjacent corner area. 
				(iii)	Third, priority shall be given to all other publications that have applied for space in the fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal unit, including, subject to Section 184.12(h)(1)(a) publications that were historically present at that area or an immediately adjacent midblock area but have already received one newsrack box in that unit or cluster on the basis of such historical presence. 
				(iv)	The Director shall implement this allocation scheme as to fixed pedestal units located at corner areas before doing so at immediately adjacent midblock areas. In implementing this allocation scheme as to each fixed pedestal unit or cluster of fixed pedestal units, the Director shall conduct a meeting at which each publication in each category, beginning with category (i), historically present publications, may select a newsrack box in a given fixed pedestal unit or cluster until all newsrack boxes have been selected. If any newsrack boxes remain unselected after each publication in category (i) that so desires has chosen a newsrack box in that fixed pedestal unit or cluster, each publication in category (ii) shall select a newsrack box until all newsrack boxes have been selected or each publication in category (ii) that so desires has chosen a newsrack box in that fixed pedestal unit or cluster, and so forth through category (iii). The publications in each category may agree among themselves as to the order they will follow in selecting newsrack boxes; if they are unable to agree, publications in categories (i) and (ii) shall select according to survey order, and publications in category (iii) shall select according to such order as the Director determines by lots. 
		(3)	Petition Units. Space in each petition unit shall be allocated as follows: 
			(A)	If possible, publications seeking space in a petition unit shall agree unanimously among themselves with respect to the allocation of space in the unit. 
			(B)	Absent such agreement, the Director shall allocate space in the unit as follows:
				(i)	First priority shall be given to each publication that was historically present in the zone, according to the most recently completed survey of that zone, and that, during initial implementation in that zone, sought but did not receive the maximum number of newsrack boxes that could be allocated to it on the basis of historical presence, in accordance with this section and the guidelines. 
					(a)	To receive first priority, each such publication, within twelve (12) months before the Director received the petition, must have been distributed from a freestanding newsrack that, according to the most recently completed survey of that zone, was located on the same block face as, or a block face that immediately adjoins and is on the same street and same side of the street as, the block face on which the petition unit will be located, and that has not previously been used successfully as a basis for first priority in space allocation in any petition unit. 
					(b)	Within the group of publications described in subsection 184.12(h)(3)(B)(i), publications shall select space in the petition unit based on frequency of publication, with all publications published at least once per week choosing first, followed by all publications published less often than once per week but more often than once per month, followed by all publications published once per month or less frequently. Within each such frequency category, publications shall select space in the petition unit in any mutually agreed upon order, or, absent such agreement, in an order determined by lots. 
				(ii)	Second priority shall be given to all other publications that have applied for space in the petition unit.
					(a)	The order it which such publications shall select space in the petition unit shall be determined according to Section 184.12(h)(3)(B)(i)(b).
					(b)	Notwithstanding subsection (a), above, if any such publication already occupies at least one newsrack box in a fixed pedestal unit located either on the same block face as the petition unit ("the petition block face"), the block face(s) immediately across the street from the petition block face, or either of the two block faces that immediately adjoin and are on the same street and same side of the street as the petition block face, that publication shall not select space in the petition unit until all other publications that have applied for space in the petition unit have received at least one such space. 
		(4)	Abandoned Newsrack Boxes. When a newsrack box in an already installed fixed pedestal unit has been abandoned or otherwise becomes available for reallocation, space in that newsrack box shall be allocated in the same manner as space in a petition unit, provided that: 
			(A)	Such a newsrack box may not be re-allocated to the publication that occupied it immediately before such re-allocation, unless no other publication seeks space in that newsrack box; 
			(B)	The twelve (12) month period within which a historically present publication must have used a freestanding newsrack in order to obtain first priority in such allocation shall consist of the twelve (12) months before the newsrack box became available for re-allocation; and 
			(C)	If the Director has held a space allocation meeting within the last 12 months in an attempt to allocate space in a particular newsrack box, but that space remains unallocated following such meeting, the Director may allocate that space on a first-come-first-served basis ("informal allocation"), provided that: 
				(i)	space cannot be informally allocated to a publication that already occupies another newsrack box in that fixed pedestal unit;
				(ii)	informal allocation must be made without regard to historic presence or frequency of publication;
				(iii)	space may only be informally allocated to a publication that has a current newsrack certificate on file, that has provided the Director with black and white camera-ready art for its name and trade dress, and that, within 10 business days after the informal allocation, pays the required fixed pedestal permit fee (a "qualified applicant"); 
				(iv)	the Director has published notice of his intent to informally allocate such space, and also has provided such notice by electronic mail to each publication that has a newsrack certificate on file; 
				(v)	DPW's website lists all newsrack boxes currently available for informal allocation; and
				(vi)	the space shall be informally allocated to the first qualified applicant to return to the Director, via fax or electronic mail, a properly completed "request to receive unallocated newsrack box" form, which form shall be available on DPW's website. 
		(5)	Relocated Fixed Pedestal Units. Space in a fixed pedestal unit that has been relocated due to excessive repair costs pursuant to s vendor contract shall be allocated in the same manner as space in a petition unit, provided that the twelve (12) month period within which a historically present publication must have used a freestanding newsrack in order to obtain first priority in such allocation shall consist of the twelve (12) months before the Director selects the location at which the fixed pedestal unit shall be installed. 
		(6)	Split Door Newsrack Boxes.
			(A)	Newsrack boxes may be split into two separate distribution areas to distribute free publications, including those historically present free publications that sought but did not receive the maximum number of newsrack boxes that could be allocated to them on the basis of historical presence, in accordance with this section and the guidelines. 
			(B)	Space within split newsrack boxes shall be allocated consistent with the guidelines, provided that:
				(i)	Any free publication may elect to designate a newsrack box in which space has been assigned to it as a split door newsrack box, so long as one-half of the split door newsrack box is continuously used to distribute that publication ("the primary publication"). 
				(ii)	The other half of the split door newsrack box may be used to distribute the primary publication, or to distribute any other free publication published by publisher of the primary publication ("a secondary publication"), regardless of the secondary publication's frequency of publication or when the secondary publication was first published or distributed. 
				(iii)	The publisher of the primary publication may substitute any one of its free publications (including the primary publication) for another as the secondary publication, consistent with this section and the guidelines, so long as one-half of the split box is continuously used to distribute the primary publication. 
		(7)	Space in Consolidated Fixed Pedestal Units. Where fixed pedestal units at an intersection have been consolidated pursuant to Section 184.12(g)(2)(E), space in each fixed pedestal unit located at that intersection following consolidation shall be allocated as follows: 
			(A)	A newsrack box that already was allocated to a publication before consolidation shall not be re-allocated as part of the consolidation process, and shall remain allocated to that publication following consolidation, unless that publication vacates, abandons, or otherwise ceases to be entitled to distribute from that newsrack box. 
			(B)	Newsrack boxes that were not allocated before consolidation shall, if possible, be allocated to publications that seek space in such newsrack boxes and that, immediately before consolidation, were being distributed from fixed pedestal units at that intersection that have been or are to be removed as a result of consolidation. Such publications shall select from the available spaces in the post-consolidation fixed pedestal unit(s) in any mutually agreed-upon order, or, absent such agreement, in an order determined by lots. Such publications shall continue to select spaces in the post-consolidation fixed pedestal unit(s) until each such publication has had an opportunity to select the same number of newsrack boxes in the post-consolidation unit(s) as it previously had been allocated in the unit(s) that were located at that intersection before consolidation and were removed as the result of consolidation. At that point, any newsrack boxes in the post-consolidation fixed pedestal unit(s) that remain unallocated shall be subject to reallocation pursuant to Section 184.12(h)(4). 
		(8)	Space in Fixed Pedestal Units Whose Size Has Been Modified. Where the size of a fixed pedestal unit has been modified pursuant to Section 184.12(g)(2)(F), space in that unit following the modification shall be allocated as follows: 
			(A)	If possible, publications that seek space in the unit and were being distributed from that unit immediately before its modification shall unanimously agree among themselves with respect to allocation of space in the unit in a writing received by the Director within ten (10) business days of the Director's notice of modification given pursuant to Section 184.12(g)(2)(F)(ii). 
			(B)	Failing such agreement, each publication that had been allocated a newsrack box in the upper left corner, the upper right corner, the lower left corner, or the lower right corner of the unit immediately before its modification shall be allowed to select the same corner newsrack box following the modification. After each such publication has had an opportunity to select the appropriate corner newsrack box, then each remaining publication that seeks space in the unit and was being distributed from the unit immediately before its modification shall have an opportunity to select from the remaining unallocated newsrack boxes in the unit, making their selections in an order determined by lots. At that point, any newsrack boxes in the unit that remain unallocated shall be subject to reallocation pursuant to Section 184.12(h)(4). 
	(i)	STANDARDS FOR DESIGN, MAINTENANCE AND DISPLAY. The vendor and permit holders shall comply with the following requirements. Failure to comply with any of these requirements shall constitute a violation of this section, and shall be grounds for imposition of penalties in accordance with subsections 184.12(j) and 184.12(k). 
		(1)	Except as this subsection or the guidelines provide otherwise, and subject to Section 184.12(d)(3)(O) with respect to the current provisions of the "First Amended and Restated Pedestal-Mounted Newsrack Agreement By and Between the City and County of San Francisco and Clear Channel Adshel. Inc.," the vendor shall be responsible for ensuring that all fixed pedestal units and newsrack boxes under its control are in compliance with the following requirements: 
			(A)	Every fixed pedestal unit and newsrack box shall be maintained in a neat and clean condition and in good repair at all times. The vendor shall be responsible for inspecting fixed pedestal units and newsrack boxes under its control to ensure compliance with this section no less than once per day Monday through Friday; 
			(B)	Every fixed pedestal unit and newsrack box shall be constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and secure condition;
			(C)	Every fixed pedestal unit and newsrack box shall be kept free of graffiti and rust, and shall be repaired on a regular basis;
			(D)	Fixed pedestal units or newsrack boxes that are damaged or defaced shall be replaced, repaired or removed within ten (10) business days from the date of written notice from the Director; 
			(E)	Except as authorized pursuant to a vendor contract with respect to advertising panels and names and logos of the vendor and/or any entities with whom it has contracted for services to performance of said contract, no fixed pedestal unit or newsrack box shall be used for advertising signs or publicity purposes other than for the advertising, identification, promotion, display, sale or distribution of the newspaper(s) or other publication(s) distributed from it; 
			(F)	Where a vendor is authorized to place advertising on fixed pedestal units, the vendor shall comply with the following requirements:
				(i)	Advertising shall be placed only on the back side of fixed pedestal units, and only on such units dispensing six or more publications;
				(ii)	Advertising on any individual fixed pedestal unit shall be less than eighteen (18) square feet in area;
				(iii)	No portion of the advertising shall extend above the top edge of the fixed pedestal unit;
				(iv)	Each fixed pedestal unit containing advertising shall have a sign adjacent to such advertising that states in typeface at least one inch high, the following disclaimer: 
ADVERTISING ON THIS NEWSRACK IS NOT CONTROLLED BY, AND MAY NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF, ANY OF THE PUBLICATIONS DISTRIBUTED WITHIN.
				(v)	The letters comprising the above disclaimer shall be printed in white reflective lettering against a black disclaimer background. The disclaimer shall be centered above or below any panel containing such advertising. 
		(2)	The permit holder shall comply with the following requirements:
			(A)	In any circumstances where the permit holder decides to vacate a location, the permit holder shall promptly notify the Director and the vendor of the intention to vacate the location; 
			(B)	All coin-operated newsrack boxes shall be equipped with a coin-return device that is maintained in good repair and working order to enable persons to secure full refunds if they are unable to receive the publication paid for. In the case of coin-operated newsrack boxes, the permittee shall be responsible, at its own cost, for the following, unless it timely elects to have the vendor assume such responsibility pursuant to the vendor contract: 
				(i)	For maintenance, repair, and replacement of all hardware related to the charging or coin mechanism or to the security of coins, including all locks and keys;

	(n)	"Street" means a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel, or property dedicated as a public street by action of the Board of Supervisors.

SEC. 184.57.  SIGNS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY PROHIBITED; EXCEPTIONS.
	(a)	Findings. The Board hereby finds and declares: The City has a compelling need to prohibit the posting of Signs on public property in order to prevent the visual pollution caused by such Signs and the resulting contributions to urban blight. Moreover, the placement of Signs on public property causes damage to such property and, when Signs are placed on or near traffic or directional signs or similar objects, threatens the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The rise in number, size and frequency of Signs on public property has increased visual clutter, risks to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic and damage to public property. This proliferation of Signs on public property also threatens the character and dignity of the City's distinctive appearance, streetscapes, thoroughfares, skyline and architectural features for both residents and visitors and also depletes limited public resources for street cleaning and maintenance. However, the Board is mindful of the importance of providing a forum for communication among citizens. While Lamp Posts and Utility Poles can provide such a forum, unrestricted use of Signs would interfere with the clear view of traffic safety signs and signals by motorists and with the unobstructed use of public streets and sidewalks. In addition, unrestricted use of Lamp Posts and Utility Poles would permit the placement of numerous Signs of widely ranging sizes and shapes which protrude beyond such poles, thereby creating an aesthetically displeasing clutter of objects on and over public streets and sidewalks. A limitation on the size, duration, and placement of Signs on Lamp Posts and Utility Poles will eliminate unsightly clutter, ensure traffic safety, and provide an opportunity for a greater number of Persons to communicate by this means. 
	(b)	Prohibited Acts. Except as expressly provided in this Article, no Person, except a duly authorized public officer or employee, or a contractor with the City, the State of California, or the United States Government acting to promote the purposes of that contract, shall erect, construct or maintain, paste, paint, print, nail, tack or otherwise fasten or affix any Sign, or cause or suffer the same to be done, on any Lamp Post, Utility Pole, traffic control sign or signal, curbstone, bench, hydrant, wall, span wire, sidewalk, bridge, tree, fence, building or structure owned or controlled by the City. 
	(c)	Exceptions for Non-Commercial Streets. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (b) of this Section, a Sign may be placed or maintained upon, or attached to, any Lamp Post or Utility Pole on a Non-Commercial Street provided that the following regulations are adhered to: 
		(1)	No more than one copy of any Sign (i.e. no duplicates) may be placed on a single Lamp Post or a single Utility Pole at any time; 
		(2)	The Sign shall be affixed to the Lamp Post or Utility Pole so that the shape of the Sign conforms to the shape of the Lamp Post or Utility Pole to which it is attached, and no part shall extend or be suspended beyond the face of the Lamp Post or Utility Pole; 
		(3)	The Sign shall not be greater than 11 inches in height;
		(4)	The edge of the Sign which is farthest from the ground when posted shall be at a height no greater than 12 feet from the ground;
		(5)	The Sign shall only be affixed with tape or non-adhesive materials, such as string, twine or other non-metal banding material. The Sign shall not be affixed with staples, nails, paste, glue, or any adhesive substance other than tape, nor affixed in a manner that causes damage to the Lamp Post, Utility Pole, any structure, or any public property. The Sign shall be posted in a fashion that ensures it is firmly secured to the Lamp Post or Utility Pole, is not loose, and does not pose any hazard to pedestrians or vehicles; 
		(6)	The Sign shall bear the Posting Date in the lower right-hand corner, legible and visible after the Sign is posted.
	(d)	Exceptions for Commercial Streets. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (b) of this Section, a Sign may be placed or maintained upon, or attached to, any Lamp Post or Utility Pole on a Commercial Street, provided that a Sign which is 11 inches in height or less must be posted in accordance with Section 184.57(c). 
	(e)	Posting Period. Every Person who has posted any Sign on any Lamp Post or Utility Pole, or who has caused such posting, as permitted by Subsections (c) and (d) of this Section, shall remove such Sign and any material used to affix the Sign within 70 calendar days of the Posting Date. Provided, however, in no event shall any Sign posted for an event or an election remain posted more than 10 calendar days after the event or the election. 
	(f)	Exclusions. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to: 
		(1)	Signs placed or maintained by the United States Government, the State of California, any department of the City, or Signs posted under the authority of the San Francisco Department of Recreation and Park, the San Francisco Port Commission, or the Department; 
		(2)	Any object placed or maintained upon, or in front of, or attached to, or above any building or premises, either wholly within the property lines or projecting beyond the property line over the public sidewalk, regulated by the provisions of Part II, Chapter I of the San Francisco Municipal Code (Building Code); 
		(3)	Any object affixed pursuant to Part II, Chapter IV of the San Francisco Municipal Code (Planning Code);
		(4)	Any object placed on a Street or sidewalk pursuant to Section 63 of Part II, Chapter VIII of the San Francisco Municipal Code (Police Code) regulating the placement of A-boards; 
		(5)	Any object placed on a Lamp Post or Utility Pole pursuant to Section 184.78 of this Code regulating the display of banners;
		(6)	Any object distributed pursuant to Sections 184.69 to 184.76, inclusive, of this Code regulating the distribution of Handbills;
		(7)	The distribution of newspapers and other printed material from newsracks or pedestal mounts on public sidewalks;
		(8)	Signs posted on kiosks or pedestal mounts designed and maintained for the posting of Signs.

SEC. 184.58.  HISTORIC AND DECORATIVE LAMP POSTS.
	(a)	Findings. The Board finds and declares that several Lamp Posts throughout the City are historic landmarks, are within historic districts, or are important aesthetic features of the City. Because of the historic and aesthetic significance of these Lamp Posts, the interest in maintaining a City which is attractive to its citizens and tourists, and promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the City's citizens, these Lamp Posts must be preserved and protected from destruction. The use of these ornate poles for the purpose of posting Signs may either threaten the preservation of these landmarks or destroy an important aesthetic feature of the city. 
	Accordingly, the City has a compelling need to prohibit the posting of Signs on the following Lamp Posts: 
		(1)	"Market Street's Path of Gold" located from 1 Market Street to 2490 Market Street. The pillars of these 33-foot high Lamp Posts were shaped to include historical subjects as decoration, including Native Americans on horseback and ox-drawn covered wagons pictured with a pioneer; 
		(2)	"Mission Street Corridor" located on Mission Street between Sixteenth and Twenty-Fourth Streets. These Lamp Posts are maroon-painted with acorn-shaped luminaries, finial tops and twin lights at different heights; 
		(3)	"Dragon Street Lanterns" located on Grant Street between Bush and Broadway Streets. These red-painted Chinese-style lanterns sit atop pillars which are ornately decorated with bronze dragons and painted aqua; the bases are painted red and white; 
		(4)	Lamp Posts on the "Embarcadero" located between King and Jefferson Streets. There are three styles of Lamp Posts on the Embarcadero having decorative bases, painted green or slate blue, and with double tear-dropped-shaped lanterns and both double and single acorn-shaped lanterns; 
		(5)	Lamp Posts on Fisherman's Wharf located between Hyde and Powell Streets. These Lamp Posts are painted slate blue, have decorative bases and single acorn-shaped lanterns; 
		(6)	Lamp Posts adjacent to the Moscone Center on Howard Street between Third and Fourth Streets. These 10 Lamp Posts are bronze cobra-shaped light fixtures designed by JCDecaux Co., a French designer of street furniture and fixtures; 
		(7)	Lamp Posts in Union Square Plaza, which is bounded by Geary Street to the south, Stockton Street to the east, Post Street to the north, and Powell Street to the west. These Lamp Posts are painted slate blue, have decorative bases and single acorn-shaped lanterns; 
		(8)	Lamp Posts located on Mason Street from Market to Sutter Streets, Sutter from Mason to Kearny Streets, Kearny Street from Bush to Market Streets. These Lamp Posts are painted gray, have gold trim, and ornately decorative bases and double acorn-shaped lanterns. 
	(b)	Posting Signs Prohibited. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Person, except a duly authorized public officer or employee or contractor with the City, the State of California, or the United States Government acting to promote the purposes of that contract, shall erect, construct or maintain, paste, paint, print, nail, tack or otherwise fasten or affix, any Sign, or cause or suffer the same to be done, on any of the following Lamp Posts: 
		(1)	"Market Street's Path of Gold" located from 1 Market Street to 2490 Market Street;
		(2)	"Mission Street Corridor" located on Mission Street between Sixteenth and Twenty-Fourth Streets;
		(3)	"Dragon Street Lanterns" located on Grant Street between Bush and Broadway Streets;
		(4)	Lamp Posts on the "Embarcadero" located between King and Jefferson Streets;

The Department is authorized to take all necessary steps, including entering into contracts with the United States Government or the State of California, to remove Signs posted on a Lamp Post or Utility Pole on, immediately abutting, or immediately adjacent to property which is under the jurisdiction of the United States Government or the State of California and is located within the City. If the City incurs any expense in removing a Sign because it was posted in violation of this Article, the Person or Persons responsible for such posting as set forth in Section 184.65 of this Article may be billed as provided in Subsection (b) of this Section. If such bill is not paid as required by Subsection (b), the Person or Persons responsible for such posting are subject to payment of a civil penalty as provided in Section 184.63 of this Article. 
	(b)	Whenever an officer or employee of the City and County of San Francisco removes any Sign posted in violation of this Article, the Director may send a bill to the Person responsible for such posting for the cost of removal or for the repair of property damaged by such posting.

SEC. 184.69.  DEFINITIONS.
	For the purposes of this Article:

	(b)	"City" means the City and County of San Francisco.
	(c)	"Department" means the Department of Public Works of the City.
	(d)	"Director" means the Director of the Department of Public Works of the City. Director shall mean and include an officer or employee of the City designated to act on the Director's behalf. 
	(e)	"Handbill" means any handbill, dodger, circular, booklet, card, pamphlet, sheet or any other kind of printed matter or literature which is distributed to or upon any premises in the City.

SEC. 184.70.  DISTRIBUTION OF HANDBILLS ON PRIVATE PREMISES.
	(a)	Findings. The Board hereby finds and declares that the City has a compelling need to prohibit the distribution of Handbills on private premises where the occupant has expressed his or her unwillingness to receive such Handbills. Prohibiting distributions of Handbills in defiance of an occupant's expressed desire not to receive them strikes an appropriate accommodation between the rights of distributors to solicit willing listeners with the rights of occupants to object to receive the material. 
	This Ordinance is also aimed at decreasing the adverse effects of the distribution of unsolicited Hand-bills on private premises. The prohibition against delivering Handbills contrary to the expressed desire of the occupant and the requirement that Handbills be folded or otherwise attached to the outside of a premises will decrease the amount of litter created by Handbills. 
	(b)	Prohibition When "No Handbills" Sign Posted. It shall be unlawful for any Person to distribute, cause to be distributed, or suffer, allow or permit the distribution of any Handbill to or upon any private premises in the City by placing or causing any such Handbill to be deposited or placed in or upon any porch, yard, steps, hallway, or mailbox located on, or used in connection with such premises when such premises has posted thereon in a conspicuous place, a notice or notices of at least eight square inches in area bearing the words "No Handbills" or the like, unless such Person has first received the written permission of the occupant of such premises authorizing the Person so to distribute. 
	(c)	Distributed Matter To Be Folded. It shall be unlawful for any Person to distribute, cause to be distributed, or suffer, allow or permit the distribution of any Handbill to or upon any private premises in the City by placing or causing any such Handbill to be deposited or placed in or upon any porch, yard, steps, hallway, or mailbox located on, or used in connection with such premises unless the same is folded or otherwise so prepared or placed that it will not be blown therefrom by the winds.

	The Director shall investigate, or cause to be investigated, all complaints made to the Department regarding the violation of any of the provisions of this Article and take such actions regarding any violation as is provided therein. 
	In undertaking enforcement of this Article, the City, including, but not limited to, the Department, is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare.

SEC. 184.78.  BANNERS.
	(a)	Findings. The Board of Supervisors hereby finds that: 
		(1)	Banners placed on the upper portion of City-owned utility poles are an important medium for providing notice to San Francisco residents, as well as those who work in and visit San Francisco, about City-sponsored, City-funded, and City-wide special events, City-convention facility events, and the locations of the City's diverse neighborhoods. 
		(2)	Because of the significant economic benefits that the City gains from tourism, San Francisco has a strong interest in fostering tourism by promoting City-sponsored, City-funded and City-wide special events, and in providing notice of the locations of the City's varied and distinct neighborhoods.

		(4)	Increasing awareness of City-sponsored City-funded and City-wide special events, and San Francisco's diverse neighborhoods also fosters civic pride. 
		(5)	By adopting this section the Board does not intend to create a public forum on the upper portion of City-owned utility poles, it has decided to make the upper portion of City-owned utility poles available for the installation of banners that announce City-sponsored events, City-funded events, City-wide special events, City convention facility events, or City neighborhoods in order to achieve its goals of promoting tourism and civic pride, and providing public notice. 
	(b)	Subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by this Section, the Department is authorized to adopt rules and regulations governing the posting of banners consistent with the terms of this Article. In enacting such rules and regulations, the Department shall consider the need to protect the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and other property and the need to promote aesthetics on the City's streets and sidewalks.

SEC. 184.83.  MOBILE FOOD FACILITY APPLICATION AND FEE PROVISIONS.
	(a)	Every person desiring a Mobile Food Facility permit pursuant to this Article shall file an application with the Director upon a form provided by the Director and shall pay a filing fee of $125.00, a notification fee of $200.00, and an inspection fee of $383.00 for a single Location for the Mobile Food Facility.

		(6)	If an existing permittee seeks a new permit for the same Location in accordance with the terms of Subsection (d)(5), but that Location no longer satisfies the requirements of Section 184.85, the Director, under such circumstances, shall strive to authorize a temporary or permanent relocation of the Mobile Food Facility to a comparable Location that meets the requirements of Section 184.85. Any such authorization shall be in writing and available at the Mobile Food Facility prior to issuance of a new permit. Notice related to the proposed temporary or permanent relocation of the Mobile Food Facility shall be subject to all applicable noticing requirements set forth in Subsection (d)(5).
		(7)	If a permittee for a Mobile Food Facility has a valid permit for a specific Location dated on or before July 1, 2013, said permittee is exempt from Subsection (d)(5) as long as the such permittee complies with all other applicable terms of this Article. As part of any permit issuance, renewal, or transfer pursuant to this Article, the Department shall include reference to the original granting date of the Mobile Food Facility permit. 
	(e)	The fees set forth in this Section are subject to the fee review and adjustment procedures of Section 2.1.2.

The fees for such permit shall be the filing, notification, and inspection fees for a single Location. Under such circumstances, Director also may charge additional permit fees as set forth in Section 2.1.3. All Mobile Food Facilities operating under a single Location permit shall comply with all other provisions of this Article.

	Exhibit Plan or Plans. When, in the judgment of the Director of Public Works of said City and County, public interest or convenience requires that any of the work mentioned in this Article be done, the expense of the whole or any part of which is to be assessed upon private property, and said Director deems the same expedient, he may by written order declare such expediency and briefly describe such work. Said Director shall cause to be preserved in the office of the Department of Public Works in permanent and appropriate form a written record of all acts pursuant to the procedure prescribed in this Article including all orders made by him hereunder, so that at all times during business hours there shall be open to the public a complete written record of all acts pursuant hereto. All orders of said Director pursuant hereto shall be identified by his signature. Upon making any such order of expediency, said Director shall cause to be prepared exhibit plan or plans, sufficient to give reasonable notice to the owners of the property liable to be assessed of the nature and extent of the proposed work. 
(Amended by Ord. 321-69, App. 11/10/69)
SEC. 188.  ORDER DECLARING INTENTION TO RECOMMEND.
	At any time after the exhibit plan or plans for the contemplated work shall have been prepared, said Director may make an order declaring his intention to recommend to the Supervisors that they order to be done the work described in his order declaring the expediency thereof, or some part or modification of such work. 
	(a)	Designation of Contemplated Work. Said order declaring his intention shall refer to the public way affected, by its lawful or official name, or the name by which it is commonly known. When the contemplated work is not upon a public street or thoroughfare, the order shall briefly describe the property or right of way on which the work is to be done. Said order will be sufficient if it states in general terms the kind of work contemplated, such as grading, paving, sewering or other improvements, gives in general the location of the proposed improvement and refers to the exhibit plan or plans therefor, for a description of the proposed work. 
	(b)	Notice of Time of Hearing. Said order declaring the intention of said Director shall also contain a notice of the day, hour, and place when and where any and all persons having any objections to the proposed work may appear before said Director and show cause why said proposed work should not be done in accordance with said order declaring the intention of said Director. Said time shall not be less than 15 days or more than 30 days from the date of making said order of intention. 
(Amended by Ord. 321-69, 11/10/69)
SEC. 189.  DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK MAY BE INCLUDED IN ONE PROCEEDING.
	Said Director may include in one proceeding, under one order declaring his intention and in one contract, any of the different kinds of work mentioned in this Article on any number of public ways, contiguous or otherwise, and he may except therefrom any of such work already done. 
SEC. 190.  OFFICIAL GRADE-PROCEEDINGS ON CHANGE.
	The grade to which any work shall be done shall be such as may be shown on the exhibit plan or plans therefor, or it may be done on such a grade as may formally have been established by the Supervisors. If any official grade already has been established for any of the public ways proposed to be improved, it shall be lawful for the order of said Director declaring his intention, to provide that said work shall be done to new grades or grades different from those so established, and said order shall refer to exhibit plan or plans for the description of the grade at which the work is to be done. Any property owner whose property is to be assessed to pay the costs of the proposed work may at the time fixed in said order for hearing objections appear before said Director and object to the proposed grade or proposed modification of grade. A failure to make objection at such time shall be deemed to be a waiver of all objections to the proposed grade or proposed change of grade and shall operate as a bar to any claims for damages or any subsequent action looking to the prevention of the work or the recovery of damages on account of the performance of the work to such grade or changed grade. The provisions of this Section relative to grades are alternative and do not affect other provisions of law relative to change of grade. 
(Amended by Ord. 321-69, App. 11/10/69)
SEC. 191.  DECLARATION OF INTENTION SHALL DESIGNATE DISTRICT BENEFITED.
	Said Director shall make the expense of such work chargeable upon the district in his opinion benefited by such work. In his said order declaring his intention he shall describe such district and declare it to be the district which will be benefited by such work. Such district may be described in such order by stating the exterior boundaries thereof, or by giving a description thereof according to any official or recorded map or maps, or by referring to the maps or block books customarily used by the Assessor and Tax Collector for City and County assessment or tax collection purposes, or by referring to a plat or map which shall be on file in the office of said Director at the time of making the order declaring his intention; said last mentioned plat or map shall indicate by a boundary line the extent of the territory included in the proposed district, and, if referred to as hereinabove provided for, shall govern for all details as to the extent of such assessment district. 
	When two or more public ways, not contiguous or directly connected, are to be improved under the same proceeding, such number of districts may be provided for therein as shall be deemed by said Director to be expedient. 
SEC. 192.  PORTION OF EXPENSE PAID OUT OF TREASURY.
	Said Director may, if he deem it advisable, and when there is an unexpended and unencumbered balance in any fund in the City and County Treasury which has been appropriated for such general purpose, and the written consent of the Chief Administrative Officer and Controller has been obtained, recommend to the Supervisors that not to exceed 2/3 of the expense of any of the work mentioned in this Article shall be paid out of said Treasury from such unexpended and unencumbered balance. Said Director shall state the fact of such intended recommendation in his order declaring his intention to recommend that the work be done, specifying in such order the amount so to be recommended for payment from the Treasury. 
	(a)	Procedure. If the Supervisors follow the recommendation in whole or in part they shall appropriate for such purpose, in the ordinance ordering the work, the amount so recommended, or such part thereof as they shall consent to; provided, however, that no such appropriation shall be made until the provisions of Section 86 of the Charter of said City and County shall have been complied with. The amount so to be paid from the Treasury shall be payable at such time or times as shall be specified in the notice calling for sealed proposals for the work. 
	Whenever any of the expense of such work is so ordered to be paid out of the Treasury said Director in making up the assessment provided for in this Article, shall, unless the Supervisors in said ordinance otherwise provide, and except as otherwise provided in SubSection (d) of Section 215, of this Article, first deduct from the whole expense of such work the amount so ordered to be paid out of the Treasury, and shall assess the remainder of said expense upon the parcels of land liable to be assessed therefor in the manner provided in this Article. 
	(b)	No Limitation. This Section shall not be construed as a limitation upon the power of the Supervisors to make an appropriation from the Treasury at any other time or in any other manner to pay not to exceed 2/3 of the cost of any work mentioned in this Article. 
SEC. 193.  ORDER DECLARING INTENTION-PROCEEDINGS.
	A copy of the order of said Director declaring his intention to recommend to the Supervisors that they order work to be done shall be published for one day in the official newspaper of said City and County. Such publication shall be made at least 10 days before the date fixed in said order for hearing thereon by said Director. A copy of said order shall be posted in the office of said Director at least 10 days before the date named in said order for action thereon by said Director. 
	(a)	Notice Requirements. Said Director shall cause notices of the making of said order to be conspicuously posted along all the streets within the district chargeable for the expense of the work, at not more than 300 feet in distance apart, on each street so posted, but not less than three on each street in such district. 
	No proceeding shall ever be held invalid for failure to post any street or streets, as in this Section provided, if the provision of this Section has been substantially complied with. All posting hereby prescribed must be completed at least 10 days before the day set for hearing on said order of said Director declaring his intention. 
	Said notice shall be headed "Notice of Improvement" in letters of not less than one inch in height, and shall, in legible characters, state the fact of the adoption of such order of said Director declaring his intention, its date, and shall briefly describe the work proposed to be done, and shall refer to said order of said Director for further particulars. Said notices shall also set out the proposed district to be assessed to pay the expense of such work. Said district shall be described in the same manner in which it shall be described in the order of said Director declaring his intention as provided for in Section 191 of this Article. Said notices shall also state that it is proposed to assess the property within such district to pay the total or partial expense of such work, as the case may be. Said notices shall also state that all objections to the proposed work or district or otherwise must be filed, in writing, with said Director before the day fixed in his said order for action thereon, or must be made orally on said day, or on the day to which action on said order may be postponed. The day, hour and place fixed in said order for action thereon shall also be indicated in said notices. 
	(b)	Mailing Requirements. The Secretary of the Department of Public Works shall cause to be mailed, at least 10 days prior to the hearing, postage prepaid, a copy of such order to each property owner whose name appears upon the assessment book of the City and County current at the time of the making of such order, and whose property is to be assessed for the proposed work or improvement. In case any lot, piece or parcel of land liable to be assessed for such work or improvement be assessed on such assessment book to "unknown owners," then no copy of such order need be mailed to the owner thereof. 
	The mailing of such copy of such order shall be to the address as the same appears upon the said assessment book as indicating the address of the owner of the property to be assessed for such work or improvement; and in case no such address appears upon said assessment book, then the mailing of such copy may be made either to an address designated in the last issue of the City directory having relation to a name corresponding to that of such owner, if such a name appear therein, or to an address obtainable from any other probably reliable source of information that may be conveniently available to the person performing such mailing to such owner may be made to the general delivery of the post office at the City and County. 
	The Supervisors, before ordering the contemplated work to be done or improvement made, may, if they deem it advisable, require an affidavit to be filed showing that the foregoing requirement for the mailing of such copies of the said order has been complied with. Such affidavit showing such mailing shall be conclusive of the facts therein recited. 
	Such requirement for such mailing of the copies of the order of intention shall not be deemed jurisdictional, and the failure of the said property owners, or any of them, to receive said copies of the said order, or any error or omission in relation to the said mailing of the same, shall in nowise affect the validity of the proceeding or prevent the Supervisors from acquiring jurisdiction to order the proposed work or improvement. Knowledge of the making of such order of intention acquired by any such owner, prior to the date of action thereon, in any manner other than by mailing to him a copy of such order, shall be deemed the equivalent of such mailing for all purposes to be subserved thereby. 
SEC. 194.  PROTESTS-DECISION OF DIRECTOR.
	At any time before the day fixed in said order of said Director for action thereon by said Director, any owner of, or person interested in, property liable to be assessed for the proposed work, or the duly authorized representative of such owner, or other person, in his behalf, may make written protest against the same or to the extent of the district to be assessed therefor, or both, or make any other protest with regard thereto. Such protest must be in writing, contain a description of the property in which each signer thereof is interested, sufficient to identify the same, set forth the nature of his interest therein, and delivered to the Department of Public Works of said City and County, the Secretary or a clerk of which shall endorse thereon the date of receipt thereof. No other protests or objections shall be considered by said Director, except oral protests made at the time at which said Director conducts the hearing mentioned in his said order. At the time set for hearing protests said Director may publicly postpone action on his said order from time to time, and all persons interested shall be deemed to have notice of such postponement and shall be governed thereby. The decision of said Director on all such protests shall be final and conclusive except in case of appeal to the Supervisors as in this Article hereinafter provided for. 
SEC. 195.  ACTION ON PROTEST-RECOMMENDATION-DIAGRAM.
	If any protest against such proposed work or proposed district or any other protest be sustained by said Director, he shall not thereby be prevented from commencing proceedings anew hereunder which shall embrace the same work and/or the same district or any part or parts of either or both thereof; and new proceedings may be had the same as if all such prior proceedings, no matter how many times instituted, had never been commenced. 
	If no protests be made against such proposed district, or if all protests made against the same be overruled by said Director, said Director shall accompany his recommendation to the Supervisors that the proposed work be ordered, with a diagram on which shall be delineated each separate parcel of land with the limits of such assessment district, the approximate dimensions of each such parcel, and its relative location to the work proposed to be done. The correctness of such diagram shall be certified by the City Engineer. Instead of said diagram said Director may accompany his said recommendation to the Supervisors with a description of such proposed district. 
SEC. 196.  RECOMMENDATION THAT WORK BE DONE.
	If the protests to any proposed work or proposed district or other protests be all overruled, or if no protests be made, said Director shall, within five days from the date of his action upon his said order declaring his intention, make an order recommending to the Supervisors that they order such work to be done, and said Director shall cause a copy of said last mentioned order to be transmitted to the Supervisors. 
	(a)	Appeal to Supervisors-Procedure. When any protests by persons having any interest in the property to be assessed have been overruled by said Director, an appeal may be taken separately by each such protestant to the Supervisors from the decision of such Director. Each such appeal shall be in writing, and shall be signed by each protestant participating therein with his place of residence set down opposite his signature and with a description of the property in which he is interested sufficient for identification of the same. Such appeal must be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Supervisors within 10 days from the date of said Director's order recommending to the Supervisors that the work be ordered done, and a copy of such appeal must be filed in the office of said Director of Public Works within two days after the date of filing such appeal with the Clerk of the Supervisors. No appeal shall be considered by the Supervisors unless the same be taken and perfected in the manner and within the time herein provided. 
	(b)	Order Overruling Protests. When said Director has overruled all such protests, he shall within five days after the date of such action make his order reciting such action, and therein recommend to the Supervisors that they order the proposed work to be done and approve the proposed assessment district and transmit a copy of such order to the Supervisors. 
	(c)	Hearing of Appeal-Notice. When an appeal or appeals shall have been taken as herein provided, the Supervisors shall fix a time for hearing the same. The Clerk of the Supervisors shall thereupon notify the persons filing such an appeal or appeals of the time fixed for the hearing by mailing a notice thereof, postage prepaid, addressed to each of said persons at his address as given in such notice of Appeal. The affidavit of said Clerk of said mailing shall be conclusive of the fact. 
	At the time so fixed for hearing the appeal, the Supervisors shall hear and pass upon the same. Such hearing may be continued from time to time and all persons interested shall be deemed to have notice thereof and shall be governed thereby. 
SEC. 197.  PROCEEDINGS BY SUPERVISORS-DELAY, EXTENT OF-WORK ORDERED BY ORDINANCE.
	The Supervisors, if they do not deny such appeal, may by resolution delay further proceedings in relation to the proposed work for not more than one year from the date of the adoption of such resolution. Upon petition of the appellants the Supervisors may continue with the proceedings from time to time during said period of delay. 
	Upon expiration of the period of delay so fixed by the Supervisors, said Director may again recommend to the Supervisors that the proposed work be done and the proposed district be confirmed, and thereupon the Supervisors, after notice to the appellants as provided for in Section 196 of this Article, shall order the work to be done and the boundaries of the proposed district confirmed or may declare an abandonment of all proceedings theretofore had in the manner. 
	The ordering of any proposed work and confirmation of any proposed district shall be by ordinance. 
SEC. 198.  ABANDONMENT OF PROCEEDINGS-RENEWAL.
	Said Director, at any stage of the proceedings for any proposed work, prior to action by the Supervisors upon his recommendation that they order the same done, may by order abandon any or all proceedings theretofore had in relation to such proposed work; and said Director may commence said proceedings anew and continue the same from any part of said proceedings not so abandoned. If said Director abandons any or all proceedings after his making an order of recommendation and before action thereon by the Supervisors, he shall cause notice of such fact forthwith to be transmitted to the Supervisors, and the Supervisors shall take no action upon the recommendation in such case. 
	If the Supervisors pass an ordinance ordering any proposed work pursuant to this Article, they may upon recommendation of said Director repeal such ordinance ordering work. 
	Said Director, from time to time after he has abandoned any proceedings for any proposed work pursuant to this Article, may institute and continue proceedings hereunder for the work theretofore proposed and abandoned, or for such work or modified work as he may determine the public interest or convenience requires, all in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this Article. 
SEC. 199.  DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENT DISTRICT REQUIRED.
	The ordinance ordering the work to be done and approving the assessment district shall contain a description of the assessment district similar to that contained in said order of said Director declaring his intention. In all other ordinances, resolutions, notices, orders and determinations, subsequent to said order of said Director declaring his intention and subsequent to the notices of hearing thereon, except the notices of recordation in the Department of Public Works of the assessment hereinafter provided for, it shall not be necessary to describe the assessment district, but it shall be sufficient to refer to said order of said Director declaring his intention for a description of the work and a description of the assessment district. 
SEC. 199.1.  PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS PREPARED.
	After the Supervisors, pursuant hereto, have passed an ordinance ordering work to be done, said Director shall cause specifications, or plans and specifications be prepared for the proposed work, as shown on the exhibit plan or plans. 
(Added by Ord. 321-69, App. 11/10/69)
SEC. 200.  NOTICE INVITING BIDS-PROCEDURE.
	After the specifications, or plans and specifications have been prepared, said Director shall cause a notice to be published for two consecutive days in the official newspaper and posted conspicuously in his office for a period of not less than 10 days, inviting sealed proposals for the contemplated work. 
	(a)	Time and Place for Receiving Bids. Said notice shall invite sealed proposals for the contemplated work to be delivered to said Director at his office, or at a place to be designated by him in said notice, on a day and during an hour to be specified therein, which shall be not less than 10 days after the date of last publication of said notice as hereinabove provided and after the first day of said posting of said notice. Said notice shall contain a description of the proposed work substantially similar to that contained in the order of said Director declaring his intention to recommend that the Supervisors order the same to be done. Said notice shall also contain a reservation of the right to reject any and all bids, and shall specify the period of time within which the work is to be completed after the date of execution of the contract therefor and the amount of the bond to be given by the awardee of the contract for faithful performance, public liability, and property damage of the same. 
	Reference to the specifications, or plans and specifications for the proposed work shall also be incorporated in and notice for further information concerning the details of the proposed work. 
(Amended by Ord. 321-69, App. 11/10/69)
SEC. 201.  BIDS AND AWARD-PROCEDURE.
	All proposals shall be made upon printed forms to be prepared by said Director and furnished gratuitously upon application. 
	Every proposal made shall be accompanied by a corporate surety bond or a check certified by a responsible bank, payable to the order of said City and County for an amount not less than 10 per centum of the aggregate of the proposal, and no proposal shall be considered unless accompanied by such bond or check. 
	No person, firm or corporation shall make, file or be interested in more than one bid for the same improvement. If on the opening of bids more than one bid appears in which the same person, firm or corporation is interested, all said last mentioned bids shall be rejected. 
	On the day and during the hour specified in said notice inviting sealed proposals, said Director shall be in his office, or in the place designated by him in said notice, and all bids shall be delivered to him within the hour named in said notice. No bid not so delivered to him shall be considered. Each bid as it shall be received shall be numbered and marked "Filed" by said Director and authenticated by his signature. At the expiration of the hour stated in said notice, said Director shall publicly open, examine and declare the same and an abstract of each bid shall be recorded in a public register to be kept by said Director for such purpose. Said Director shall immediately compare the bids with the record so made, and shall thereupon or at such other time not exceeding 20 days thereafter award the contract for the work to the lowest reliable and responsible bidder, except as otherwise herein provided. Notice of such award shall be caused to be posted for five days by said Director in some conspicuous place in the office of the Department of Public Works and such notice shall be published once in the official newspaper. Said Director may reject any and all bids and may reject the bid of any bidder who has been delinquent or unfaithful in any former contract with said City and County and must reject all bids other than the bid of the lowest reliable and responsible bidder; and, on accepting said lowest bid, he shall thereupon return to the proper parties the bonds or checks corresponding to the bids so rejected. If all the bids are rejected said Director shall return all the bonds or checks to the proper parties and may again invite sealed proposals for the proposed work as in the first instance. 
	The bond or check accompanying the accepted bid shall be held by said Director until the contract for doing said work as hereinafter provided has been entered into, either by said lowest bidder, or by owners as hereinafter provided, whereupon said corporate surety bond or certified check shall be returned to said bidder. If said bidder fails, neglects or refuses to enter into a contract to perform the work as in this ordinance hereinafter provided then the corporate surety bond or certified check accompanying his bid and the amount therein mentioned shall be declared by order of said Director to be forfeited to said City and County, and the proceeds thereof shall be collected by the Treasurer and paid into the treasury of said City and County and credited to the item or items of the annual appropriation for the improvement of streets and sewers, unless said Director, or the Supervisors on appeal, duly remit such forfeiture. 
SEC. 202.  OWNERS' ELECTION TO DO WORK.
	The owners of at least ¾ of the assessable area of the assessment district shall not be required to present sealed proposals, but may upon making an oath that they are such owners, within 10 days after the publication of the notice of award, elect to enter into a written contract with said director to do the whole work specified in said award at the price or prices at which the same has been awarded. 
	Should such owners not enter into such a contract for said work within said time the awardee to whom the contract has been awarded shall enter into a contract for said work within seven days after the expiration of the time within which said owners might have entered into a contract for the same. 
SEC. 203.  IRREGULARITIES-PROTEST-FAILURE TO PROTEST.
	At any time within five days from the date of the publication of the notice of award hereunder of a contract for work, any owner of, any other person having any interest in, any parcel of land liable to be assessed for such work, who claims that any of the previous acts or proceedings relating to said work are irregular, defective, erroneous or faulty, may file in the office of said Director of Public Works a written notice specifying in what respect or respects said acts or said proceedings are irregular, defective, erroneous or faulty. Said notice shall state that it is made pursuant to this Section, and shall contain the address of the person filing the same, and a description of the property owned by or in which he is interested sufficient to identify the same. 
	All objections to any act or proceeding occurring prior to the time within such objections are permitted to be filed in relation to said work, not made in writing and in the manner and at the time aforesaid, shall be deemed waived.

SEC. 231.  BONDS AND COUPONS-RECORDATION.

	(a)	Preparation and Recordation. Said Director of Public Works shall cause said bonds and coupons to be fully prepared for execution and shall supervise the execution thereof by the proper parties as hereinbefore provided for.

	Said Director shall also cause all such payments to be entered in an appropriate book of record in his office to the credit of the appropriate bond and assessment. And every such assessment shall remain a first lien upon the property affected until said assessment and the bond based thereon, and the accrued interest thereon and the penalties, if any, thereon shall be fully paid according to the terms of said bond. 
	(c)	Execution of Bonds Evidence of Regularity. Said bonds, by their execution, shall be conclusive evidence of the regularity of all proceedings theretofore had under this Article. 
	(d)	Certificate of Sale. Said Director is hereby authorized to make any sale authorized by any such bond and shall issue for each sale an original and duplicate certificate of sale in appropriate form, referring to this Article, describing the parcel or parcels of land sold and containing the name of the Purchaser. The original shall be delivered to the Purchaser and the duplicate shall be kept on file and record in the office of said Director. 
SEC. 232.  DEED TO PURCHASER IF NO REDEMPTION.
	If the property sold, as provided in the above proceedings, be not redeemed within one year after the sale, said Director shall then issue to the party named in the original certificate, or his assignee, a deed of the property described in said certificate, which said deed shall refer, in general terms, to the proceedings under which the same is issued, and shall contain a description of the property, following the description in the certificate; the grantee in such deed is immediately upon receipt thereof entitled to possession of the property described therein. 
SEC. 233.  REDEMPTION-DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
	At any time before the expiration of one year from the date of the certificate of sale, any property sold under the provisions of the preceding Sections may be redeemed by any person having an interest in the property sold, by the payment to said Director of the amount for which property was sold, with an additional penalty of one percent per month of the amount for which the same was sold; all such redemption money shall be paid over by said Director to the Treasurer with a statement indicating the specific bond to which such money shall be credited, and the Treasurer shall pay all such redemption money to the holder of the proper original certificate of sale, upon delivering up the same and receipting for the amount received.

SEC. 235.  NONEXECUTION OR INVALID BOND-LIEN RIGHTS.
	In case it shall appear at any time that any bond made as herein provided has not been executed by the owner or owners of the property described therein, or that for any reason any such bond is invalid, or that a sale in accordance with its terms would not convey a full and clear title to such property, then the person entitled to collect and receipt for the payment of the original assessment, or his assigns, shall have the right to foreclose the lien thereof for any unpaid portion, as such lien was originally imposed and such lien shall continue until such original assessment is fully paid. 
SEC. 236.  BOND MAY BE EXECUTED AFTER EXPIRATION OF TIME.
	The bond provided for in Section 229 of this Article may be made, executed and filed in accordance with and subject to the requirements, terms and conditions in this Article prescribed for such bond, after the expiration of the time, as therein provided for, within which to make, execute and file such bond, if the contractor to whom an assessment, payable in installments, has been issued, or his assignee, or other owner of such assessment, shall consent to the making, executing and filing of such bond after such expiration of time, and such consent shall be expressed on the back or margin of such bond. 
SEC. 237.  ASSESSMENT EXCEEDING $200.
	Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, said Director of Public Works may in the assessment and warrant provided for in Sections 215 and 216 of this Article make each assessment which exceeds $200 payable in annual installments. No such annual installment payment shall exceed five percent of the benefit conferred on said property on which the assessment is levied measured in terms of the cost of said street improvement plus interest on the outstanding balance due. As used in this Section the term "benefit conferred" shall refer to the cost of the improvement apportioned by the said Director pursuant to Section 215(b) of this Article. 
	The dates for payment of installments on an assessment shall not extend over a period of more than 10 years from the date when the first installment will be payable. The assessment made by said Director shall state the number of installments in which the assessment payable in installments may be paid, the respective dates for payment of the several installments, and the rate of interest, not to exceed the percentum per annum set by law by the State of California, to be charged on all deferred payments. The first installment shall be payable at the time provided for in Section 229 of this Article. Every assessment and accrued interest, however, may be paid in cash at any time, unless suit has been filed thereon or unless a bond has been executed thereon. 
	(a)	Appeal Prerequisite to Court Action. No objection whatsoever relative to the making of such an assessment payable in installments as in this Section provided for, or relative to the amount of any such assessment or assessment installment, or relative to the time or manner of payment of any such assessment or assessment installment may be made in any manner or in any court or tribunal except by such party or parties as shall have appealed to the Supervisors in the manner provided for in Section 217 of this Article. All persons who have not so appealed to the Supervisors shall be deemed to have waived every objection in this Section referred to. 
	(b)	Assessment Amended or Reassessment Made. Any assessment which violates any of the provisions of this Section or Section III of the Charter of said City and County may be amended or corrected, in the manner in this Article provided for the amendment or correction of an assessment, or a reassessment may be made as in this Article provided for, in order that such original assessment may be made to conform to this Section and Section III of said Charter. 
(Amended by Ord. 368-82, App. 7-30-82)
SEC. 238.  REASSESSMENT-CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MADE.
	Whenever any assessment heretofore made or issued or filed or which may be hereafter made, issued or filed pursuant to this Article or any other ordinance is or shall be void or unenforceable, for any cause, or if bonds shall have been or shall be, issued to represent or be secured by any assessments and such issuance shall not have been, or shall not be, effective through the curative provisions in relation thereto, then, in any of such events, a reassessment therefor may be issued. The true intent and meaning of this Section is to make the cost and expense of work or improvement made through an attempted compliance with this Article, payable by the real estate benefited by such work or improvement by making a reassessment therefor. 
	Such power of reassessing embraces both a full and a partial reassessment, and is not exhausted by a single attempted exercise thereof. 
	A reassessment shall be ordered by the Board of Supervisors under any one of four circumstances. 
	(a)	Request of Holder. Where the owner or holder of any assessments, or bonds issued under this Article to represent or be secured by assessments, or the person who would own or hold any such assessment or bonds if the same were issued, requests the Supervisors to order a reassessment. In such event, if said Supervisors be of the opinion that the assessments or bonds in question are not enforceable, they shall order the making and issuing of a reassessment covering only the assessments owned or held by the petitioner, or the assessments represented or secured by the bonds owned or held by such petitioner, or which would be owned or held by petitioner if issued. 
	(b)	Unenforceable Lien by Court Decree. Whenever any court of competent jurisdiction in any suit to foreclose the lien of any assessment or to enforce the obligation of any bond issue to represent or be secured by any assessments issued under this Article, has for any reason held such lien unenforceable, then it shall in and by its decree direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in such suit. 
	(c)	Voidance by Court Decree. Whenever any court of competent jurisdiction in any suit to set aside the lien of any assessment or of any bond representing any assessment, or in any suit to quiet title against the lien of any such assessment, or bond, or in any suit to enjoin the making, filing, conformation or issuance of any assessment or bond to pay for the cost and expense of any work done hereunder, shall in its judgment decree such assessments or bonds to be void, or unenforceable, or shall enjoin the making, filing or issuance of conformation of any such assessment or bond, then it shall, in and by its decree, direct the making of a reassessment to cover the assessments involved in such suit. 
	(d)	Payment for Work Done Under Void Proceedings. Whenever any contractor or assignee of a contractor shall have done or performed any work or improvements pursuant to proceedings had and taken in attempted compliance with the provisions of this Article, and whenever prior to the issuance of any assessment, any court of competent jurisdiction in any suit to invalidate the contract or any of such proceedings shall for any reason declare said contract or other proceedings to be invalid, then such court shall, in and by its decree, direct the making of an assessment for the reasonable value of the work and improvement actually done and performed in good faith by the contractor, or such portion thereof as was of a kind that could lawfully have been ordered under the provisions of this Article. 
SEC. 239.  REASSESSMENT-PROCEDURE.
	The manner of making, issuing and enforcing the reassessments shall be as follows: 
	Said Director of Public Works shall, upon the entering of a decree of court directing a reassessment or upon the making of an order by the Supervisors directing a reassessment, proceed to make a reassessment in the following manner: 
	(a)	Partial Reassessment. If the reassessment be a partial one only, then it shall not be necessary for the diagram to show any other lots than the ones covered by such partial reassessment. 
	(b)	Full Reassessment. If it be a full reassessment, however, then said Director shall prepare and file with the reassessment a diagram showing the lots, pieces or parcels of land deemed by him to have been benefited by the work or improvement. 
	(c)	Fixing Boundaries. Upon any reassessment as in this Article provided for, said Director and the Supervisors shall have unlimited power to fix the boundaries of the district to be charged with the expense of the work in accordance with the benefits of the work to property as such benefits, at the time of reassessment, shall appear to said Director or the Supervisors, and to make the boundaries of such district either the same as they theretofore were or different from the boundaries of the district specified in said Director's declaration of intention. 
	(d)	Amount of Reassessment. It is the intent hereof that upon any such reassessment said Director and/or the Supervisors then shall have full power to determine what district and property have been benefited by the work and to make the reassessment accordingly. The reassessment shall assess upon and against each of the lots, pieces or parcels of land contained therein an amount arrived at as follows: The benefits derived, or to be derived by each of the said lots, pieces or parcels of land from the work or improvement, estimated as of the date of the filing in the office of the Department of Public Works of the original assessment, shall first be listed. Then there shall be added thereto interest thereon from the date of filing the original assessment in the Department of Public Works at the rate set by the Director, and the total sums shall constitute and be the amount of the proposed several assessments in such reassessment. The total of such reassessments, however, exclusive of interest, shall not exceed the cost and expenses of the work or improvement. 
	(e)	Procedure. Such assessment need not be in any prescribed form, but shall refer to the original assessment filed, give the date of filing of said original assessment and state that it is made pursuant to the order of the Supervisors or decree of the court, as the case may be, and shall be accompanied by a diagram showing the lots to be reassessed and their relation to the work. It shall then be presented to the Supervisors, who shall fix a time for hearing before them. Such time must be at least 20 days after the reassessment is so presented. The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall then advertise the time of such hearing before the Supervisors by publishing a notice once in the official newspaper. Said Clerk shall also mail notice of such hearing as provided for in Section 193 of this Article. But this requirement as to mailing notice shall have no greater effect than that provided for in said Section 193 of this Article. And a description of the district shall be set forth in the notice. 
	(f)	Hearing of Objections. At the time fixed for said hearing, or at such time or times to which the same may be thereafter adjourned, the Supervisors shall consider the objections to said reassessment and in their discretion informally direct the revision, correction or modification of such reassessment in such manner as is most equitable to apportion to each lot, piece or parcel of land hereby benefited the amount of the actual benefits derived from said improvement. When such reassessment shall have been revised, or corrected, or modified so as to comply with the judgment of said Supervisors, then they shall pass a resolution confirming the reassessment. The said Director of Public Works shall thereupon record the reassessment with a certificate at the end thereof by the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. Said Director shall also note opposite the several assessments in the original assessment that have been displaced, the fact that the reassessment has been made, giving its date, and shall credit upon such reassessment all payments theretofore made upon the original assessment, or upon the bonds issued to represent the same, together with interest on such payments at the rate set by the Director, from and after the date of such payments. Such reassessment shall be collectible and payable in the same manner as an original assessment and shall be enforceable by suit in the same manner provided in this Article for enforcing an original assessment, and shall have the same weight in evidence. In the event that bonds shall have been issued under or upon the security of the original assessment, they shall also issue upon the reassessment for such sum as may be reassessed against the lots, pieces or parcels of land covered thereby. 
	(g)	Cancellation of Original Assessment. When the reassessment is recorded the original assessment shall be cancelled by said Director so far as the reassessment affects the original assessment involved. New bonds shall not be issued until the original bonds are delivered up to the City and County Treasurer, who shall cancel the same. The lien of such reassessment shall hold its relative rank as to other special assessment liens as of the date of filing of the original assessment. 
	(h)	Costs and Expenses. In the event such work or improvement made in attempted compliance with this Article is fully completed to the satisfaction of said Director, then it shall be the duty in any event of said Director to make and file an assessment for costs and expenses thereof so as to form the basis of a reassessment, even though such assessment should be unenforceable. 
(Amended by Ord. 368-82, App. 7/30/82)
SEC. 240.  SUBSTITUTE FOR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS OR CITY ENGINEER.
	If the Director of Public Works, for any reason whatsoever, may not perform any of the duties or functions by this Article imposed upon him, or if it becomes inconvenient for him to perform any such duties or functions, then, in every such case, such duties and functions may be performed by the City Engineer in said Department of Public Works, as a substitute for said Director, or, in any such case, said duties and functions may be performed by anyone in said Department designated by the Chief Administrative Officer of said City and County. The duties and functions hereby imposed upon said City Engineer may be performed by anyone else in said Department designated by said Director. Whenever such a substitute shall act, either for said Director or for said City Engineer, the records of said Department shall include a written designation by said Chief Administrative Officer or said Director, as the case may be, appointing such substitute. Such designation shall indicate the period during which such substitute shall be authorized so to act. Such written designation shall be conclusive of all facts therein recited, and all acts of such substitutes, respectively, shall have the same validity as if they had been performed by said Director or said City Engineer, as the case may be.

SEC. 242.  DUTY OF DIRECTOR REGARDING PUBLICATION, POSTING, ETC.

No proceeding or step herein shall be invalidated or affected by any error or mistake or departure herefrom as to the officer or person posting, or procuring the publication or posting, of any resolution, notice, order or determination hereunder when the same is actually published or posted for the time herein required. 
SEC. 243.  "INCIDENTAL EXPENSES," DEFINITION OF-DEMANDS.

MAINTENANCE DISTRICTS
SEC. 250.260.  NEW MAINTENANCE DISTRICTS.
	(a)	Whenever the Board determines it to be appropriate, the cost of capital replacement, maintenance and operation of any public improvement or facility of a local nature may be financed pursuant to proceedings undertaken pursuant to this Subdivision. Such proceedings are alternative to any other procedures available under general law or ordinance heretofore or hereafter enacted by the Board. 
	(b)	Board Powers: The Board may, by resolution, declare its intention to order that the costs and expenses of maintaining and operating any or all public improvements or facilities of a local nature, including the cost of necessary repairs, replacements, fuel, power, electrical current, care, supervision, and any and all other items necessary for the proper maintenance and operation, including replacements, improvements and extensions thereof, shall be assessed either partly or wholly upon such district as the Board shall determine will be benefited by the maintenance and operation of the public improvements or facilities proposed to be so maintained; the amounts so assessed to be collected in the same manner and by the same officers as taxes for City purposes are collected. 
	(c)	Purpose: The purpose of this Section is to provide an alternative procedure by which the Board may provide for the payment of the whole or any part of the costs and expenses of maintaining and operating any public improvements or facilities, or portion thereof, which are primarily local in their nature or benefit, payable from annual benefit assessments apportioned among the several lots or parcels of property within the maintenance district established therefor, the nature and formula or formulae for which is to be determined in the proceedings in which jurisdiction is provided therefor. 
	(d)	Resolution of Intention: The resolution of intention shall contain a statement of the formula or formulae upon and by which annual assessment levies for the payment of said costs and expenses will be apportioned according to benefits among the several lots or parcels of property within the maintenance district to be established therefor. The application of said formula or formulae shall not involve the exercise of discretion and said formula may prescribe a maximum rate or amount of annual benefit assessment to be levied for such purposes. Districts formed for parking or transit purposes shall also be subject to Subdivision 5 of this Subarticle. 
	(e)	Written Protests and Oral Objections: In connection with the hearing provided for the establishment of the maintenance district, owners of property within the district may file written protests against, may make oral objections to, and may be heard as to, the fairness of said formula or formulae in the same manner, at the same time and with like legal effect as provided for in other written protests and oral objections in Chapter 26 of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Streets and Highways Code. 
	(f)	Initial Modification: At the hearing, the Board, of its own volition or in response to any protest made, heard or considered, may make modifications in the formula or formulae for the purpose of making the same fairer and more equitable; provided, however, that before making a final order in said matter it shall set said matter for hearing at a subsequent meeting of the Board, which hearing it shall call or to which it may adjourn; provided, further, that it shall give notice of the time, place and purpose of said hearing by one publication in a newspaper in which the original resolution of intention or notice of improvement or notice of hearing on the formation of the maintenance district was published, at least 10 days prior to the hearing. If the formula or formulae includes a maximum rate or amount of annual benefit assessment and such modification consists solely of a decrease in such maximum rate or amount of annual benefit assessment, the Board may order such decrease by resolution and no hearing need be had thereon. 
	(g)	Majority Protests: If the Board finds that protests thereto are made by the owners of more than ½ of the area of the property in the maintenance district subject to benefit assessment to pay said costs of maintenance and operation, no further proceedings shall be taken for a period of six months from the date of the decision of the Board on the a hearing, unless the protests are overruled by an affirmative vote of the majority of all the members of the Board. The Board may adjourn the hearing from time to time. 
	(h)	Determination: At the initial hearing or at the subsequent hearing on the modification of the formula or formulae as herein provided or at any meeting to which either shall have been adjourned, or at any meeting of the Board subsequent to the full hearing of said matter, with or without the matter having been submitted, the Board, by resolution, shall finally adopt a formula or formulae for the apportionment of benefits in said annual assessment levies, which formula or formulae shall be that stated in the resolution of intention or said separate resolution, or as modified; and its determination shall be final and conclusive against all persons. 
	(i)	Subsequent Modification: If, at any time following the final establishment of the formula or formulae for the annual assessment levies, the Board shall by resolution determine that by reason of changed conditions or because of defects or insufficiencies therein disclosed by its application, the established formula or formulae is in any way or particular inequitable or unfair, or may be made fairer and more equitable, the Board may by resolution so declare, stating the reasons therefor, and fix a time and place of hearing thereon. 
	(j)	Id.-Notice: The Clerk shall cause a copy of such resolution to be published once in a newspaper in which the resolution of intention or notice of improvement or notice of hearing on the formation of the maintenance district in said proceedings was published; to be mailed, postage prepaid, to all owners of property within the district; and to be posted on or near the Board Chamber door or any bulletin board in or adjacent to the City Hall.

	In the order declaring his intention the Director shall describe the district, declare it to be the district which will be benefited, and describe the benefit formula to be applied. 
	Such district may be described in the order by stating the exterior boundaries thereof, or by giving a description thereof according to any official or recorded map or maps, or by referring to the maps or block books customarily used by the Assessor and Tax Collector for City and County assessment or tax collection purposes, or by referring to a plat or map which shall be on file in the office of the Director at the time of making the order declaring his intention: said last-mentioned plat or map shall indicate by a boundary line the extent of the territory included in the proposed district, and, if referred to as hereinabove provided for, shall govern for all details as to the extent of such district. 
(Amended by Ord. 91-81, App. 2/20/81)
SEC. 265.  ORDER DECLARING INTENTION-PROCEEDINGS.
	A copy of the Director's order declaring his intention to recommend the forming of a district shall be published for one day in the official newspaper of said City and County. Such publication shall be made at least 10 days before the date fixed in said order for hearing by the Director. A copy of said order shall be posted in the office of the Director at least 10 days before the date named in the order for action by the Director. 
	(a)	Notice Requirements. Said Director shall cause notices of the making of said order to be conspicuously posted along all the streets within the district chargeable for the expense of the maintenance district, at not more than 300 feet in distance apart, on each street so posted, but not less than three on each street in such district. The notice shall be headed "Notice of Maintenance District" in letters of not less than one inch in height, and shall, in legible characters, state the fact of the adoption of such order of the Director declaring his intention, its date, and shall briefly describe the items proposed to be maintained, and shall refer to said order of the Director for further particulars. Said notices shall also set out the proposed district to be assessed to pay the expense of such maintenance district. Said district shall be described in the same manner in which it shall be described in the order of the Director deciding his intention as provided for in Section 264 of this Article. Said notice shall also state that it is proposed to assess the property within such district to pay the total or partial expense of such maintenance as the case may be. The notices shall also state that all objections to the proposed maintenance district or otherwise must be filed, in writing, with the Director before the day fixed in his said order for action thereon, or must be made orally on said day, or on the day to which action on said order may be postponed. The day, hour and place fixed in said order for action thereon shall also be indicated in said notices. 
	(b)	Mailing Requirements. The Director shall cause to be mailed, at least 10 days prior to the hearing, postage prepaid, a copy of such order to each property owner whose name appears upon the assessment book of the City and County current at the time of the making of such order, and whose property is to be assessed for the proposed maintenance district. In case any lots, piece or parcel of land liable to be assessed for such maintenance district be assessed on such assessment book to "unknown owners," then no copy of such order need be mailed to the owner thereof. 
	The mailing of such copy of such order shall be to the address as the same appears upon the said assessment book as indicating the address of the owner of the property to be assessed for such maintenance district; and in case no such address appears upon said assessment book, then the mailing of such copy may be made either to an address designated in the last issue of the city directory having relation to a name corresponding to that of such owner, if such a name appear therein, or to an address obtainable from any other probably reliable source of information that may be conveniently available to the person performing such mailing, or such mailing to such owner may be made to the general delivery of the post office at the City and County. 
	The Board, before ordering the contemplated maintenance district be formed, may, if they deem it advisable, require an affidavit to be filed showing that the foregoing requirement for the mailing such copies of the said order has been complied with. Such affidavit shall be conclusive of the facts therein recited. 
	Such requirement for such mailing of the copies of the order of intention shall not be deemed jurisdictional, and the failure of the said property owners, or any of them, to receive said copies of the said order, or any error or omission in relation to the said mailing of the same, shall in nowise affect the validity of the proceeding or prevent the Supervisors from acquiring jurisdiction to order the proposed maintenance district. Knowledge of the making of such order of intention acquired by any such owner, prior to the date of action thereon, in any manner other than by mailing to him a copy of such order, shall be deemed the equivalent of such mailing for all purposes to be subserved thereby. 
	(c)	Substantial Compliance. No proceeding shall be held invalid for failure to post any street or streets, as in this Section provided, if the provision of this Section has been substantially complied with. All posting hereby prescribed must be completed at least 10 days before the day set for hearing on said order of said Director declaring his intention.

	(b)	For temporary street space occupancy for any purpose other than a building construction operation, the fee shall be $57.62 per day with no assessment cost. Unless specified otherwise, such occupation is subject to all provisions of Sections 724 et seq. 
	(c)	Nonprofit organizations with tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code shall be exempt from payment of the fee where the street occupancy is necessary for the development of low and moderate income housing as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
	(d)	Refund. If a permittee elects to relinquish all or a portion of the occupied street space prior to termination of the permit, the permittee may seek a refund of fees and occupancy assessment from the Department. There shall be no fee charged for a refund request. Refunds shall be issued based only on one-month increments. 
	(e)	Fee and Assessment Review. Beginning with fiscal year 2012-2013, the permit fee and street occupancy assessment set forth in this Section may be adjusted each year, without further action by the Board of Supervisors, to reflect changes in the relevant Consumer Price Index, as determined by the Controller. No later than April 15th of each year, the Director shall submit its current fee and occupancy assessment schedule to the Controller, who shall apply the price index adjustment to produce a new fee schedule and occupancy assessment for the following year. No later than May 15th of each year, the Controller shall file a report with the Board of Supervisors reporting the new fee schedule and occupancy assessment and certifying that: (a) the permit fees produce sufficient revenue to support the costs of providing the services for which the permit fee is assessed, and (b) the permit fees do not produce revenue which is significantly more than the costs of providing the services for which each permit fee is assessed. Notwithstanding the above, the Board of Supervisors, in its discretion, may modify the street occupancy assessment at any time. 
	(f)	Additional Fees. In instances where administration of this permit program or inspection of a street space occupancy is or will be unusually costly to the Department, the Director, in his or her discretion, may require an applicant or permittee to pay any sum in excess of the amounts charged above. This additional sum shall be sufficient to recover actual costs incurred by the Department and shall be charged on a time and materials basis. The Director also may charge for any time and materials costs incurred by other agencies, boards, commissions, or departments of the City in connection with the administration or inspection of the street space occupancy. Whenever additional fees are charged, the Director, upon request of the applicant or permittee, shall provide in writing the basis for the additional fees and an estimate of the additional fees.

		"Public Improvements" shall be defined as physical improvements to the public right-of-way intended to promote pedestrian and bicycle safety, to provide increased sidewalk area for pedestrians, and to promote environmentally sound street design, and to enhance the aesthetic appeal of streets. Such improvements include, but shall not be limited to, sidewalk widening, sidewalk widening at corners, medians, raised pedestrian crossings, and bicycle facilities, and are generally described in the Better Streets Plan or its successor document, Neighborhood Plans, or neighborhood streetscape plans.
	(b)	Gift Acceptance of Public Improvements.

Such sidewalk bulb-out shall satisfy all other provisions of this Section. Any such gift shall be applicable only to that additional portion of sidewalk necessary to construct the sidewalk bulb-out in relation to the: (a) then existing official sidewalk width if the sidewalk width remains unchanged within the Immediate Property Frontage or (b) new official sidewalk width if the sidewalk width within the Immediate Property Frontage has been expanded. With the exception of that additional portion of sidewalk necessary to construct the sidewalk bulb-out as set forth above, the property owner shall be solely responsible for such Improvements in accordance with Public Works Code Section 706. In such instances, the Department of Public Works official maps shall delineate the division of responsibility between the City and the property owner.
		(3)	If the subject Public Improvements specified in Subsection (c)(1) result in expansion of sidewalk width outside of the Immediate Property Frontage and such sidewalk improvements meet all the standard City requirements for sidewalk design and materials, then while the Department may accept such Public Improvements as a gift, then the fronting owner shall be solely responsible for such Improvements in accordance with Public Works Code Section 706.
		(4)	Notwithstanding the requirement of Subsection (c)(3) above, a gift of Public Improvements may include a sidewalk bulb-out outside of the Immediate Property Frontage. Any such gift shall be applicable only to that additional portion of sidewalk necessary to construct the sidewalk bulb-out in relation to the: (a) then existing official sidewalk width if the sidewalk width remains unchanged outside of the Immediate Property Frontage or (b) new official sidewalk width if the sidewalk width outside the Immediate Property Frontage has been expanded and such sidewalk improvements meet all the standard City requirements for sidewalk design and materials.

In such instances, the Department of Public Works official maps shall delineate the division of responsibility between the City and the fronting owner. 
		(5)	If the subject Public Improvements to be located on the sidewalk portion of the public right-of-way outside of the Immediate Property Frontage of the property owner are not improvements that meet all the standard City requirements for design and materials or are comprised of any form of encroachment, including street furniture, then the Director, in his or her discretion, may decline to accept all or a portion of such Public Improvements as a gift. In such instances, the Director may process the permitting and approval of such Public Improvements in accordance with applicable provisions of the Public Works Code and may issue a permit or permits to: (a) the property owner if the property owner assumes permit responsibility for the nonstandard design and materials or encroachments; (b) the fronting owner(s) if such fronting owner(s) consent to assume responsibility for the nonstandard design and materials or encroachments; or (c) both.
	(d)	Limitation of Gift Acceptance to Department of Public Works Jurisdiction.

	(f)	Departmental Approval by Street Improvement Permit. The Department shall approve such Public Improvements pursuant to a street improvement permit as set forth in Public Works Code Article 2.4 for accepted streets or Article 9 for unaccepted streets and said permit shall be accompanied by security as required by the Department. Said permit may be combined with other Departmental permits associated with the subject project.
	(g)	Gift to Include Cost of Maintenance. The gift for such Public Improvements shall be accompanied by a maintenance endowment of at least 20% of the estimated cost of construction of the Improvements as determined by the City Engineer; provided however, that the Director may reduce the cost of this endowment, but in no case shall the reduction be less than 10% of the cost of construction of the Improvements. The Department shall deposit all such maintenance funds into a public improvement gift maintenance account.
	(h)	Public Improvement Gift Maintenance Fund. There is hereby created a Public Improvement Gift Maintenance Fund wherein all funds received under the provisions of this Section shall be deposited. Said fund shall be a Category 8 fund in accordance with Administrative Code Section 10.100-1. All expenditures from the Fund shall be for administrative, engineering, legal, or technical work related to the maintenance of such improvements and equipment directly related to such maintenance, including but not limited to labor costs and any future construction associated with the Public Improvements. All such expenditures are hereby appropriated for said purposes.
	(i)	Acceptance and Dedication of Public Improvements. The Board of Supervisors delegates authority to the Director of Public Works to accept and dedicate the Public Improvements for public use, designate them for any or all public street and roadway purposes, and accept the Improvements for City maintenance and liability purposes once the City Engineer has determined that the Public Improvements have been constructed according to City standard and the satisfaction of the Department and are ready for their intended use.
	(j)	DPW Regulations. In addition to the requirements set forth in this Section, the Director may adopt such orders, policies, regulations, rules, or standard plans and specifications as he or she deems necessary in order to preserve and maintain the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience. Such orders, policies, regulations, or rules may include, but are not limited to, permit application materials, site conditions, accessibility of sidewalks and streets, submission of as-built plans as a precondition to acceptance. When such orders, policies, regulations or rules will affect the operations and enforcement of the Municipal Transportation Agency, the Director of the Department of Public Works shall consult with and provide an opportunity to comment to the Municipal Transportation Agency prior to adoption of such orders, policies, regulations, or rules.

If the Urban Forestry Council fails to forward said findings to the Board of Supervisors within 120 days of the Urban Forestry Council's receipt of the nomination request, the Board of Supervisors may, in its discretion, schedule a public hearing on the nomination, in which event, the failure of the Urban Forestry Council to forward said findings within the 120 day period shall constitute its approval of the nomination. 
			(A)	If the nominated tree is on private or public property, the Council shall provide mailed notice of the hearing to the subject property owner and all property owners adjoining the subject property where the tree is located at least seven (7) days prior to its hearing. The Council, in its discretion, also may provide delivered notice of the hearing to residents adjoining the subject property, posted notice, or both. 
			(B)	If the subject property exceeds one (1) acre in size, the Council shall provide posted notice in lieu of the mailed notice. Such notice shall be posted on at least two locations on each block face(s) tangent to the subject property at least seven (7) days prior to its hearing.

		(4)	Designation. Upon the recommendation of the Urban Forestry Council, the Board of Supervisors, by ordinance, may designate as a "landmark tree" any tree within the territorial limits of the City and County of San Francisco that meets the adopted designation criteria, or may rescind such designations. If the Urban Forestry Council does not issue findings in a timely manner pursuant to Subsection (b)(3), the Board of Supervisors shall adopt its own findings as part of the designation of a landmark tree. 
	(c)	Landmark Tree Designation Recorded Notice and Official Book. Upon Board of Supervisors designation of a landmark tree, the Department or affected agency shall record a notice on the subject property concerning the landmark tree.

If the landmark tree is a street tree under the maintenance responsibility of the Department, the Department shall record the landmark tree designation in a separate section of the Landmark Tree book that is reserved for those landmark trees under the maintenance responsibility of the Department. The Department shall maintain this book for public review and update it on a regular basis with the assistance of affected agencies. 
	(d)	Temporary Designation of Landmark Tree Status.
		(1)	At the time a member of the Board of Supervisors introduces a resolution of intent to initiate a nomination and submits to the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors the information required for a landmark tree nomination request as set forth in Section 810(b)(2), the subject tree shall be temporarily designated as a landmark tree ("temporary designation") and be subject to the provisions governing landmark trees set forth herein while proceedings are pending on the landmark tree designation. At the time the Planning Commission or Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board adopts a resolution of intent to initiate a nomination, temporary designation of the subject tree shall occur. If the Director of the Department or the director of any other City agency, commission or department initiates landmark tree designation, temporary designation shall occur when the Urban Forestry Council adopts a resolution determining that the subject tree qualifies for landmark tree status. In addition, the Director of the Department shall have the authority to issue an emergency order that temporarily designates a tree on private property or on any property under the jurisdiction of the Department to prevent the immediate removal of a tree. Upon initiation of a nomination pursuant to this Section, the entity initiating nomination shall immediately inform the Director who shall immediately cause a notice to be provided to the relevant department or private property owner informing them of the special permit and approval requirements pursuant to Section 810(f). 
		(2)	If 215 days have elapsed from the date of temporary designation and final action on landmark tree designation has not been completed, the temporary designation status for the subject tree shall expire unless the Board of Supervisors adopts a resolution to extend the temporary designation. Such extension shall not exceed 90 additional days. 
		(3)	Although the subject tree ultimately may be designated as a landmark tree sometime after expiration of temporary designation status, once the temporary designation has expired or is rejected as set forth below in Subsection (5), the affected tree shall not be subject to a new temporary designation for at least two years from the date of temporary designation. 
		(4)	The 215-day term of temporary designation or any additional term, if extended through Board of Supervisors action pursuant to this Section, shall automatically be extended 30 additional days from the date the Mayor either signs the ordinance designating the subject tree as a landmark tree or the 10th day after the Clerk of the Board refers said ordinance to the Mayor and the ordinance is not signed or vetoed. 
		(5)	If the Board of Supervisors rejects a resolution of intent to initiate nomination of a tree or the Urban Forestry Council rejects a nomination under subsection (b)(3), the temporary designation shall automatically terminate.

SEC. 823.  PROCEDURES.
	The procedures described in this Section shall be followed in the resolution of tree disputes between private parties. 
	(a)	Initial Reconciliation. A complaining party who believes in good faith that the growth, maintenance or location of a tree on the private property of a tree owner diminishes the beneficial use or economic value of his or her property because the tree interferes with the access to sunlight or views naturally accruing to the property, shall notify the tree owner in writing of these concerns. The notification should, if possible, be accompanied by personal discussions to enable the complaining party and tree owner to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
	(b)	Community Board Mediation. If the initial reconciliation attempt fails, the complaining party may propose mediation with the Community Boards of San Francisco as a means to settle the dispute on a relatively informal basis. Acceptance of mediation by the tree owner shall be voluntary. Parties should be encouraged to give notice to immediate neighbors and solicit input. The Community Board mediator should consider the objectives, benefits and burdens set forth in this Article in attempting to help both parties reach a resolution of the dispute. 
	(c)	Tree Claim Preparation. In the event that the initial reconciliation process fails and Community Board mediation either is not elected or fails, the complaining party must prepare a tree claim as defined in Section 822(j), and provide a copy to the tree owner in order to pursue either binding arbitration or litigation. This process constitutes the filing of a tree claim.

(Added by Ord. 445-88, App. 9/28/88)
SEC. 824.  STANDARDS FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES.
	In resolving the tree dispute, the tree arbitrator or court shall consider the benefits and burdens derived from the alleged obstruction within the framework of the purposes of this Article as set forth in Section 821 in determining what restorative actions, if any, are appropriate. In proposing any given restorative action the complaining party shall have the burden of proving that the burdens posed by the tree owner's trees outweigh the benefits provided by the trees with respect to the proposed restorative action. 
	(a)	Burdens.
		(1)	The hazard posed by a tree to persons or structures on the property of the complaining party including, but not limited to, fire danger and the danger of falling limbs or trees. 
		(2)	The extent to which the tree diminishes the amount of sunlight available to the garden or home of the complaining party.
		(3)	The extent to which the tree interferes with efficient operation of a complaining party's pre-existing solar energy system.
		(4)	The existence of landmarks, vistas or other unique features which cannot be seen because of growth of trees since the acquisition of the property. 
		(5)	The extent to which the alleged obstruction interferes with sunlight or view. The degree of obstruction shall be determined by means of a measuring instrument or photography. 
		(6)	The extent to which solar access or the view is diminished by factors other than trees.
		(7)	Deleterious effect of the tree upon the complaining party's vegetation through loss of heat and light except that the dropping of leaves or maintenance factors shall not be a burden under this ordinance. 
	(b)	Benefits.
		(1)	Visual quality of the tree, including but not limited to, species characteristics, size, growth, form and vigor.
		(2)	Location with respect to overall appearance, design, and/or use of the tree owner's property.
		(3)	Soil stability provided by the tree considering soil structure, degree of slope, and extent of the tree's root system.
		(4)	Visual, auditory and wind screening provided by the tree to the tree owner and to neighbors.
		(5)	Energy conservation and/or climate control provided by the tree.
		(6)	Wildlife habitat provided by the tree.
		(7)	The economic value of the tree as measured by criteria developed by the International Society of Arboriculture and the economic value of the property as a result of the tree. 
		(8)	Other tree-related factors, including, but not limited to:
			(i)	The degree to which the species is native to the local region or area;
			(ii)	Indigenous nature of the species to which the tree belongs;
			(iii)	Specimen tree quality;
			(iv)	Rare tree species, and the frequency of new planting of a tree;
			(v)	Landmark tree designation, as determined pursuant to Section 811 of the Public Works Code.
	(c)	Restorative Actions.
		(1)	Restorative actions may include written directions as to appropriate timing of trimming, thinning, topping, or removal. Such restorative actions are to apply only to current parties to the agreement. The tree arbitrator or court may require compensation to the tree owner for value lost due to restorative actions. 
	Possible restorative actions may include (i) no action, (ii) trimming, (iii) thinning, (iv) delayed trimming or thinning, (v) topping, or (vi) tree removal with possible replacement plantings. 
		(2)	Restorative actions shall be limited to the trimming and/or thinning of branches where possible and practical. Trimming or thinning may be on a delayed basis, providing time for the top of the tree to grow above the point where it obstructs sunlight or view. 
		(3)	When trimming and/or thinning of branches is not a feasible solution, the impact on the health of the tree shall be considered before topping is required. 
		(4)	In those cases where tree removal eliminates or significantly reduces the tree owner's benefits, required replacement plantings shall at the tree owner's option be set forth in writing prior to the tree removal. The tree owner may elect tree removal with replacement plantings (as an alternative to trimming, thinning and topping). 
		(5)	All trimming, thinning, topping and tree removal required under this ordinance may be performed by a person or firm selected by the tree owner with the concurrence of the complaining party, except that in the event that the complaining party is not obligated to bear any of the cost for such action, his or her concurrence is not required. The use of a certified arborist for such work is especially encouraged; in the case of Landmark trees, use of a certified arborist is required. 
		(6)	The extent of solar access or view available and documentable as present at any time during the tenure of the complaining party is the limit of restorative action which may be required. 
		(7)	No restorative action may be required concerning any tree the base of which is more than 300 feet from the immediate vicinity of the dwelling of the complaining party's property. If no dwelling exists, the distance shall be determined from the most likely dwelling site upon the property or from the geographical center of the property at the discretion of the arbitrator or court as appropriate. 
		(8)	A tree which has been the subject of restorative action under the terms of this ordinance is exempted from other property owners' claims for a period of five years from date of filing of a tree claim.

(Added by Ord. 445-88, App. 9/28/88)
SEC. 826.  LIABILITIES.
	(a)	The issuance of Community Board mediation findings, an arbitration report or a court decision shall not create any liability of the City with regard to the restorative actions to be performed. 
	(b)	The complaining party shall indemnify and hold harmless the tree owner with respect to any damages or liability incurred by said owner arising out of the performance of any work at the behest of the complaining party as follows:

RESTRICTION OF USE OF POTABLE WATER FOR SOIL COMPACTION AND DUST CONTROL ACTIVITIES
Sec. 1100.Findings.Sec. 1101.Restriction of Use of Potable Water.Sec. 1102.Application Procedure.Sec. 1103.Use of Non-potable Water.Sec. 1104.Inspections; Stop Orders.Sec. 1105.Penalties.Sec. 1106.Rules and Regulations.Sec. 1107.Governmental Projects.
SEC. 1100.  FINDINGS.
	(a)	The entire state of California is suffering from the effects of a fifth consecutive drought year, which include the reduction of available water supplies to extremely limited levels. Rationing programs have been established in most areas of the state, including the City and County of San Francisco. Although recent rainstorms have lessened the severity of the drought, existing water supplies remain at extremely low levels. 
	(b)	The drought highlights the need to permanently manage water resources in a prudent manner. The responsibility for management of San Francisco's water resources is under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission ("Commission"). The Board of Supervisors should exercise its legislative authority to assist the Commission in achieving its goals. 
	(c)	The Commission has found that the use of high quality potable water for construction and demolition purposes in San Francisco is widespread. The use of such water supplies is not necessary for many construction and demolition purposes. Non-potable water is available for such purposes from various sources, including wastewater reclamation facilities and permitted groundwater wells. Use of non-potable water from those sources for construction and demolition purposes would not present a health or safety hazard if used in accordance with applicable State Department of Health and State Water Resources Control Board standards and requirements. 
	(d)	The Commission has found that the use of increasingly scarce supplies of high quality potable water for soil compaction and dust control is no longer feasible or in the public interest when appropriate substitute sources of non-potable water are available. 
	(e)	The Commission's findings are adopted by this Board. Furthermore, this Board finds that public interests in the preservation of high quality potable water for important human consumption uses would be best served by prohibiting the use of such water supplies for soil compaction or dust control when alternative supplies are available. 
(Added by Ord. 175-91, App. 5/10/91)
SEC. 1101.  RESTRICTION OF USE OF POTABLE WATER.
	Potable water shall not be used for soil compaction or dust control activities undertaken in conjunction with any construction or demolition project occurring within the boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco, unless permission is obtained from the City Water Department in accordance with this Article and all applicable Water Department policies and regulations. 
(Added by Ord. 175-91, App. 5/10/91)
SEC. 1102.  APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
	(a)	Except as provided in Subsection (f), any person or entity that desires to use potable water for soil compaction or dust control activities to be undertaken in conjunction with a construction or demolition project occurring within the boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco shall apply to the General Manager of the Water Department for permission for such use of potable water. 
	(b)	Permission to use potable water for soil compaction or dust control activities may be granted by the General Manager if he or she determines in writing that: 
		(1)	Reclaimed water is not available in sufficient quality and quantity from wastewater treatment facilities located within 10 miles of the construction or demolition site; and 
		(2)	Well water or groundwater is not available in sufficient quality and quantity from wells and groundwater sources located within 10 miles of the construction or demolition site. 
	(c)	The cost of obtaining reclaimed water, well water or groundwater shall not be used as a factor in determining whether such water supplies are available. 
	(d)	Any person applying for permission to use potable water for soil compaction or dust control activities shall have the burden of providing sufficient evidence to the General Manager of the unavailability of reclaimed water, well water and groundwater supplies. 
	(e)	The General Manager's permission to use potable water pursuant to this Article may contain any conditions necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Article. 
	(f)	The Director of Public Works shall promulgate rules and regulations that will provide for an exemption from this Article for categories of small construction or demolition projects that commonly consume less than approximately 500 gallons of water per day. This exemption shall be implemented through the process of issuing construction-related permits and shall be based on project size, cost, characteristics or any other criteria or assumptions that reasonably accomplish the intent of this subsection. 
(Added by Ord. 175-91, App. 5/10/91)
SEC. 1103.  USE OF NON-POTABLE WATER.

SEC. 1201.  FINDINGS.
	The Board of Supervisors finds that: 
	(a)	It is the responsibility of all water users in California to make effective use of available water resources. In San Francisco, water is distributed by the Water Department, a department of the Public Utilities Commission, which also supplies water to 2.6 million people in San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda counties. The San Francisco Department of Public Works constructs and operates wastewater reclamation facilities and administers building, plumbing and structural construction codes. 
	(b)	The comprehensive management of urban water supplies should consider programs for developing the use of nonpotable and reclaimed water supplies. The Department of Public Works discharges approximately 100 million gallons per day of treated wastewater into San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. If this wastewater is given further treatment, it may be capable of being used for irrigation and other nonpotable purposes, thereby reducing potable water demand, and potentially making water available for conjunctive use, groundwater recharge, and other environmental benefits. Further, groundwater in aquifers beneath San Francisco may be utilized for potable and nonpotable purposes. 
	(c)	In 1989 the Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 389-89 urging the Department of Public Works and Water Department to expand wastewater reclamation and reuse in San Francisco. Preliminary feasibility studies prepared in 1989 indicated that reclamation could be a viable source of water for use within the City. Based on the results of the preliminary studies, the Departments began development of more extensive studies that will be completed in mid-1992. Preparation of these studies has involved many departments, including the Fire Department, Recreation and Park Department, City Planning Department, Department of Public Health, and several citizen and technical advisory groups. Public meetings have been held beginning in July 1991 and will continue for the duration of the projects. 
	(d)	If established, a comprehensive nonpotable and reclaimed water use program would result in the development of facilities to reclaim and reuse treated wastewater to assist in meeting the future water requirements of the City by supplementing existing surface and groundwater supplies. 
	(e)	Nonpotable and reclaimed water are resources that should be developed for beneficial use wherever it is reasonable to do so, consistent with legal requirements, economic considerations, the public health, safety and welfare, and the preservation of the environment. 
	(f)	This ordinance will enhance achievement of the City's goals for water supply use and preservation and protection of the environment by requiring the Water Department and the Department of Public Works to prepare a coordinated, comprehensive citywide plan for the efficient expansion of the use of reclaimed water and groundwater sources by all water consumers in San Francisco.

SEC. 1301.  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
	The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that: 
	(a)	Graffiti is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the community in that it promotes a perception in the community that the laws protecting public and private property can be disregarded with impunity. This perception fosters a sense of disrespect of the law that results in an increase in crime; degrades the community and leads to urban blight; is detrimental to property values, business opportunities and the enjoyment of life; is inconsistent with the City's property maintenance goals and aesthetic standards; and results in additional graffiti and in other properties becoming the target of graffiti unless it is quickly removed from public and private property. 
	(b)	Graffiti results in visual pollution and is hereby deemed a public nuisance. Graffiti must be abated as quickly as possible to avoid detrimental impacts on the City and County and its residents, and to prevent the further spread of graffiti. 
	(c)	Graffiti is increasingly used by gangs to frighten residents of neighborhoods. Therefore, gang graffiti, in particular, exacerbates the degradation of San Francisco's quality of life. In order to alleviate this fear caused by gang graffiti, and to assist the partnership between the City and County and the neighborhoods in their mutual efforts to make streets safe, gang graffiti must be abated as quickly as possible. 
	(d)	It is the purpose of this Article to provide a program for the removal of graffiti from walls, pavement, structures and other improvements on both public and private property.

SEC. 1304.  VIOLATIONS.
	(a)	Notice of Violation. Where the Director determines that any property contains graffiti in violation of Section 1303, the Director may issue a notice of violation to the property owner. At the time the notice of violation is issued, the Director shall take one or more photographs of the alleged graffiti, and shall make copies of the photographs available to the property owner upon request.

The notice shall give the owner thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice to either remove the graffiti or request a hearing on the notice of violation, and shall set forth the procedure for requesting the hearing. The notice shall also inform the owner that where the owner fails to either remove the graffiti or request a hearing within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice, the Director may initiate proceedings in accordance with this Article to enter upon the owner's property and abate the graffiti at the owner's expense. The notice shall further inform the owner that the minimum charge for removing graffiti is the greater of either $500 or the actual cost to the City, (including overhead and administrative costs, as well as attorneys' fees where the Director has elected to seek recovery of attorneys' fees). The Director shall serve the notice of violation as follows: 
		1.	One copy of the Notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the building or property.
		2.	One copy of the Notice shall be served upon each of the following:
			A.	The person, if known, in real or apparent charge and control of the premises or property involved;

SEC. 1305.  REQUEST FOR HEARING; HEARING.
	(a)	Request for Hearing. A property owner may request a hearing in order to contest the notice of violation issued in accordance with Section 1304 by filing with the Director within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice of violation, a request for hearing that specifies in detail the basis for contesting the notice of violation. 
	(b)	Notice of Hearing. Whenever a hearing is requested pursuant to this Section, the Director shall, within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the request, notify the property owner of the date, time, and place of the administrative review hearing by certified mail. Such hearing shall be held no later than forty-five (45) calendar days after the Director receives the request, unless time is extended by mutual agreement of the affected parties. 
	(c)	Submittals for the Hearing. At least five (5) City business days prior to the hearing, the property owner and the City shall submit to the hearing officer and exchange with one another, written information including, but not limited to, the following: a statement of the issues to be determined by the hearing officer, a statement of the evidence to be offered at the hearing and the identity of any witnesses to appear at the hearing. 
	(d)	Hearing Procedure. The hearing shall be conducted by a neutral hearing officer from a City office or department outside the Department of Public Works, appointed by the Director of Administrative Services. The burden of proof to establish that the property contains graffiti shall be on the City. The owner shall be entitled to present evidence and demonstrate that his or her property does not contain graffiti. The property owner shall also be entitled to present evidence and demonstrate that his or her property is burdened with a disproportionate share of graffiti vandalism, based on factors such as the frequency or extent of the graffiti, such that requiring the owner to remove the graffiti would result in an unfair hardship. All testimony shall be under oath, and witnesses maybe cross-examined. The hearing officer shall ensure that a record of the proceedings is maintained. The determination of the hearing officer after the hearing shall be final and not appealable. 
	(e)	Decision. The hearing officer shall issue a decision including a summary of the issues and the evidence presented, and findings and conclusions, within ten (10) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing.

SEC. 1306.  ABATEMENT BY DIRECTOR.
	(a)	Following the hearing if the City sustains its burden of proof, or if the property owner does not request a hearing and fails to remove the graffiti within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice of violation, the Director may immediately order that the graffiti be abated. Unless the Director has obtained written consent from the property owner to enter the property and remove the graffiti, before initiating abatement the Director shall obtain a court order authorizing the Department of Public Works to enter upon the property and remove the graffiti and give written notice of the abatement (Abatement Order) served in accordance with Section 1304(a). The Director may not order a graffiti abatement action that may violate the California Art Preservation Act (California Civil Code Sections 987 et seq.) or the Federal Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 (17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.) without first consulting with the City Attorney. 
	(b)	Alternatively, the Director may provide paint for graffiti removal to a property owner at no charge. In return, the property owner shall agree in writing to paint over the graffiti giving rise to the violation within 10 City business days from receiving the paint. A property owner's failure to paint over the graffiti within that time shall be ground for the Director to issue a new notice of violation under Section 1304. 
	(c)	If the hearing officer determines that a hardship exists, the Director is authorized to remove the graffiti at no cost to the property owner, provided that the owner releases the City from liability by providing the Director with a signed waiver of liability. The Director may develop forms for this purpose. 
	(d)	The following procedures shall apply to actions by the Director to abate and recover costs for abatement of graffiti on private property: 
		(1)	Abatement Action. After obtaining a court order, the Director shall implement the Abatement Order. The Director may enter upon the property and cause the removal, painting over or other eradication of the graffiti as the Director deems appropriate. The Director shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than that where the graffiti is located, except where the Director determines in a written notice to the owner that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community. Where the Director removes graffiti in accordance with the requirements of this Article, the owner shall pay the greater of either $500 or the actual cost (including overhead and administrative costs, as well as attorneys' fees where the Director has elected to seek recovery of attorneys' fees) of removing the graffiti. The Director shall provide an accounting to the owner of the costs of the abatement action (Abatement Accounting) on a full cost recovery basis not later than 10 days from the date the abatement action is completed. The Abatement Accounting shall include all administrative costs incurred by the City in abating graffiti on the property. The total amount set forth in the Abatement Accounting shall be due and payable by the owner within 30 days from the date of mailing of the Abatement Accounting. 
		(2)	Recovery of Attorneys' Fees. At the time the abatement action is filed, the Director may elect to seek recovery of attorneys' incurred in a graffiti abatement action under this Article. In a case where the Director makes this election, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorneys' fees. In no event shall the award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the City in the action. 
		(3)	Lien. If all or any portion of the amount set forth in the Abatement Accounting remains unpaid after 30 days of the mailing of the Abatement Accounting, such portion shall constitute a proposed lien on the property which was the subject matter of the Abatement Action. Except as otherwise specified in this subparagraph, such liens shall be imposed in accordance with Chapter 10, Article XX of the Administrative Code. Property owners seeking to challenge the amount of the Abatement Accounting may do so at the hearing authorized under Chapter 10, Article XX of the Administrative Code. 
			(A)	In addition to the requirements imposed under Section 10.232 of the San Francisco Administrative Code, the notice to the property owner of the hearing on the proposed lien shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Where, after diligent search, the owner of record cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation. 
			(B)	Any lien authorized by this Section shall specify the amount of the lien, the name of the department initiating the abatement proceeding, the date of the abatement order, the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. 
			(C)	Where a lien authorized by this Section is discharged, released or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, the Tax Collector shall record a notice of the discharge containing the information specified in subparagraph (B). Any such notice of discharge shall be subject to the Release of Lien Fee imposed pursuant to Section 10.237 of the San Francisco Administrative Code. 
		(4)	Special Assessment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article XX of Chapter 10, pursuant to Section 38773.5 of the California Government Code, the Board of Supervisors may order that the amount of the lien be specially assessed against the parcel. Upon such an order, the entire unpaid balance of the costs, including any penalty and interest payments on the unpaid balance to the date that the Director reports to the Board shall be included in the special assessment lien against the property. The Director shall report charges against delinquent accounts to the Board of Supervisors at least once each year. At the time the special assessment is imposed, the Director shall give notice to the property owner by certified mail, and shall inform the property owner that the property may be sold by the Tax Collector for unpaid delinquent assessments after three years. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All tax laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ordinary municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which a cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

SEC. 1307.  STAY OF PROCEEDINGS DURING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
	In any case in which a criminal prosecution is pending or is about to be instituted for violation of Penal Code Sections 594 and 640.6, or of any other law that authorizes a court to sentence a criminal defendant to remove graffiti placed on property by that defendant, the Director may suspend abatement actions under this Article. In such a case, the abatement action shall be suspended only in connection with any property upon which the defendant is charged with placing graffiti, and only until such time as the defendant is sentenced or the case is otherwise closed. This provision shall not prohibit a property owner from removing graffiti from his or her own property during such time as the criminal proceeding is pending.

(Added by Ord. 32-02, File No. 012234, App. 3/22/2002)
SEC. 1403.  IMPOUNDMENT.
	(a)	The Director may immediately impound an empty shopping cart located on either (1) public property outside the premises or parking area of a retail establishment, or (2) private property where the property owner has requested that the shopping cart be removed. Upon removal pursuant to this section, the Director shall give the owner of the shopping cart or his or her agent notice within 24 hours following the impound. That notice shall inform the owner or his or her agent as to the location where the shopping cart may be claimed. For purposes of this section, the parking area of a retail establishment located in a multistore complex or shopping center shall include the entire parking area used by the complex or center. 
	(b)	Any shopping cart impounded pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be held at a location that is both reasonably convenient to the owner of the shopping cart, and which is open at least six hours of each business day.

Otherwise, the Director shall give notice to the entity or person that the Director has reason to believe is the owner. Where an empty shopping cart contains indicia that it belongs to a particular company or retailer with more than one location in the City, but the cart contains no indication as to which location it belongs to, the Director shall make reasonable efforts to locate and notify the owner or agent. In the case of a retailer with multiple locations in the City, the Director may satisfy this requirement by providing notice to the retailer's headquarters office, if located in San Francisco, or to the retailer's area or regional office. Retailers may submit to the Director the name of one contact person or office to be the designated agent for notice by mail or telephone under this Article. Where an empty shopping cart lacks sufficient markings to enable the Director to determine the owner or owner's agent, the Director may treat the empty shopping cart as abandoned property. 
	(d)	The Director can comply with the notice requirements imposed by this section by placing a telephone call during regular business hours to the owner or owner's representative designated pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, or on the shopping cart. Where no such person is designated, the Director shall call the owner at a number listed in the San Francisco telephone book. In addition, the Director shall give mailed notice to the address designated by the owner pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, or in the absence of such a designation, to the address indicated on the shopping cart, or in the absence of such an address, to the address listed for the owner in the San Francisco telephone book.

	(f)	Any impounded shopping cart that is not reclaimed by the owner or his or her agent within two business days following the date of notice pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be subject to payment of the actual costs incurred by the City in impounding and storing the shopping cart. The City shall have a lien on the shopping cart, and shall not release the shopping cart until such costs are paid in full by the retailer or the person(s) collecting the carts at the time of collection from the Department of Public Works. 
	(g)	Any impounded shopping cart that is not reclaimed by the owner or his or her agent within 30 days following the receipt of notice pursuant to paragraph (a) may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Director.

The hearing shall be conducted within five business days of the date the Director receives the request, and shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Director.

		(1)	Any act, omission, or negligence of a Permittee or its any agents, successors, or assigns while engaged in the permitting, construction, installation, or maintenance of any Personal Wireless Service Facility authorized by a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, or while in or about the Public Rights-of-Way that are subject to the Permit for any reason connected in any way whatsoever with the performance of the work authorized by the Permit, or allegedly resulting directly or indirectly from the permitting, construction, installation, or maintenance of any Personal Wireless Service Facility authorized under the Permit; 
		(2)	Any accident, damage, death, or injury to any of a Permittee's contractors or subcontractors, or any officers, agents, or employees of either of them, while engaged in the performance of the construction, installation, or maintenance of any Personal Wireless Service Facility authorized by a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, or while in or about the Public Rights-of-Way that are subject to the Permit, for any reason connected with the performance of the work authorized by the Permit, including from exposure to radio frequency emissions; 
		(3)	Any accident, damage, death, or injury to any Person or accident, damage, or injury to any real or personal property in, upon, or in any way allegedly connected with the construction, installation, or maintenance of any Personal Wireless Service Facility authorized by a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, or while in or about the Public Rights-of-Way that are subject to the Permit, from any causes or claims arising at any time, including any causes or claims arising from exposure to radio frequency emissions; and 
		(4)	Any release or discharge, or threatened release or discharge, of any hazardous material caused or allowed by a Permittee or its agents about, in, on, or under the Public Rights-of-Way. 
	(b)	Defense of the City. Each Permittee agrees that, upon the request of the City, the Permittee, at no cost or expense to the City, shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City against any claims as set forth in Sections 1525(a) above, regardless of the alleged negligence of City or any other party, except only for claims resulting directly from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the City. Each Permittee specifically acknowledges and agrees that it has an immediate and independent obligation to defend the City from any claims that actually or potentially fall within the indemnity provision, even if the allegations are or may be groundless, false, or fraudulent, which obligation arises at the time such claim is tendered to the Permittee or its agent by the City and continues at all times thereafter. Each Permittee further agrees that the City shall have a cause of action for indemnity against the Permittee for any costs the City may be required to pay as a result of defending or satisfying any claims that arise from or in connection with a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, except only for claims resulting directly from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the City. Each Permittee further agrees that the indemnification obligations assumed under a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit shall survive expiration of the Permit or completion of installation of any Personal Wireless Service Facility authorized by the Permit. 
	(c)	Additional Requirements. The Department may specify in a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit such additional indemnification requirements as are necessary to protect the City from risks of liability associated with the Permittee's construction, installation, and maintenance of a Personal Wireless Service Facility. 
(Added by Ord. 12-11, File No. 100041)
SEC. 1526.  INSURANCE.
	(a)	Minimum Coverages. The Department shall require that each Permittee maintain in full force and effect, throughout the term of a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, an insurance policy or policies issued by an insurance company or companies satisfactory to the City's Risk Manager. Such policy or policies shall, at a minimum, afford insurance covering all of the Permittee's operations, vehicles, and employees, as follows: 
		(1)	Workers' compensation, in statutory amounts, with employers' liability limits not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, injury, or illness. 
		(2)	Commercial general liability insurance with limits not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage, including contractual liability, personal injury, products and completed operations. 
		(3)	Commercial automobile liability insurance with limits not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage, including owned, non-owned and hired auto coverage, as applicable. 
		(4)	Contractors' pollution liability insurance, on an occurrence form, with limits not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) each occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage and any deductible not to exceed twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000) each occurrence. 
	(b)	Other Insurance Requirements.
		(1)	Said policy or policies shall include the City and its officers and employees jointly and severally as additional insureds, shall apply as primary insurance, shall stipulate that no other insurance effected by the City will be called on to contribute to a loss covered thereunder, and shall provide for severability of interests. 
		(2)	Said policy or policies shall provide that an act or omission of one insured, which would void or otherwise reduce coverage, shall not reduce or void the coverage as to any other insured. Said policy or policies shall afford full coverage for any claims based on acts, omissions, injury, or damage which occurred or arose, or the onset of which occurred or arose, in whole or in part, during the policy period. 
		(3)	Said policy or policies shall be endorsed to provide thirty (30) days advance written notice of cancellation or any material change to the Department. 
		(4)	Should any of the required insurance be provided under a claims-made form, a Permittee shall maintain such coverage continuously throughout the term of a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, and, without lapse, for a period of three (3) years beyond the expiration or termination of the Permit, to the effect that, should occurrences during the term of the Permit give rise to claims made after expiration or termination of the Permit, such claims shall be covered by such claims-made policies. 
		(5)	Should any of the required insurance be provided under a form of coverage that includes a general annual aggregate limit or provides that claims investigation or legal defense costs be included in such general annual aggregate limit, such general aggregate limit shall be double the occurrence or claims limits specified in Section 1526(a) above. 
	(c)	Indemnity Obligation. Such insurance shall in no way relieve or decrease a Permittee's or its agent's obligation to indemnify the City under Section 1525 above. 
	(d)	Proof of Insurance. Before the Department will issue a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit, a Permittee shall furnish to the Department certificates of insurance and additional insured policy endorsements with insurers that are authorized to do business in the State of California and that are satisfactory to the City evidencing all coverages set forth in Section 1526 (a) above. 
	(e)	Self-Insurance. Where a Permittee is self-insured, and such insurance is no less broad and affords no less protection to the City than the requirements specified in Section 1526(a) above, the Department, in consultation with the City's Risk Manager, may accept such insurance as satisfying the requirements of Section 1526(a) above. Evidence of such self-insurance shall be provided in the manner required by the City's Risk Manager.

SEC. 1527.  FEES AND COSTS.
	(a)	Application Fees. City departments shall impose fees for review of an Application for a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit. The purpose of these fees is to enable City departments to recover their costs related to reviewing an Application for a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit. 
		(1)	Department Application Fee. Each Applicant for a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit shall pay to the Department a non-refundable Application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each Personal Wireless Service Facility proposed in the Application. 
		(2)	Other City Department Application Fees.

No later than April 15th of each year, the Director shall submit the current fee schedule to the Controller, who shall apply the CPI adjustment to produce a new fee schedule for the following year. No later than May 15th of each year, the Controller shall file a report with the Board of Supervisors reporting the new fee and certifying that the fees produce sufficient revenue to support the costs of providing the services for which the Permit fee is charged, and that the fees do not produce revenue that exceeds the costs of providing the services for which each Permit fee is charged. 
	(d)	Discretion to Require Additional Fees. In instances where the review of an Application for a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit is or will be unusually costly to the Department or to other City departments, the Director, in his or her discretion, may, after consulting with other applicable City departments, agencies, boards, or commissions, require an Applicant for a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit to pay a sum in excess of the amounts charged pursuant to this Section 1527. This additional sum shall be sufficient to recover actual costs incurred by the Department and/or other City departments, agencies, boards, or commissions, in connection with an Application for a Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permit and shall be charged on a time and materials basis. Whenever additional fees are charged, the Director, upon request, shall provide in writing the basis for the additional fees and an estimate of the additional fees. 
	(e)	Deposit of Fees. All fees paid to the Department for Personal Wireless Service Facility Site Permits shall be deposited in the Public Works Excavation Fund established by San Francisco Administrative Code Section 10.100-230. All other fees shall go directly to the appropriate City department. 
	(f)	Reimbursement of City Costs. A City department may determine that it requires the services of a technical expert in order to evaluate an Application for a Personal Wireless Service Facility. In such case, the Department shall not approve the Application unless the Applicant agrees to reimburse the applicable City department for the reasonable costs incurred by that department for the services of a technical expert.

ARTICLE 26*:
ILLEGAL DUMPING
Sec. 1600.Title.Sec. 1601.Purpose and Intent.Sec. 1602.Definitions.Sec. 1603.Prohibited Dumping Activity.Sec. 1604.Abatement.Sec. 1605.Enforcement  Injunctive Relief, Civil Penalties, Costs, and Attorneys' Fees.
SEC. 1600.*  TITLE.
	This Article shall be known as the "Illegal Dumping Ordinance."
(Added by Ord. 73-11, File No. 110222, App. 5/5/2011, Eff. 6/4/2011)
SEC. 1601.*  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
	The Board of Supervisors finds and declares that:
	(a)	Dumping on streets, sidewalks, public rights-of-way, and other public properties within the City and County of San Francisco is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the community and is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. Dumping in public spaces creates urban blight and not only impedes the paths of travel for pedestrian and vehicular traffic and is detrimental to businesses and personal pursuits, but pollutes public spaces with potentially harmful and toxic substances, degrades neighborhoods, and encourages others to unlawfully dispose of other waste and debris, all fostering a disrespect of public property and of the community.
	(b)	Cleaning up and abating unlawfully dumped material on public properties costs the City and County of San Francisco tens of thousands of dollars a year. The City is rarely able to recoup those costs from the individuals and entities who commit the illegal dumps.
	(c)	Because dumping on public properties and rights-of-way is hereby deemed a nuisance, immediate and effective abatement against the parties responsible for the unlawful dumping is essential to deter these illegal acts and may be accomplished through the judicial procedures outlined herein.
	(d)	The City is enacting this legislation pursuant to and in accordance with California Government Code Section 38771, and California Civil Code Sections 3479 and 3480.
	(e)	Nothing in this Article shall be construed to in any way limit the City's right to enforce any other provision of the Municipal Code or state law, or to create a duty or obligation on the part of the City to enforce this Article.
(Added by Ord. 73-11, File No. 110222, App. 5/5/2011, Eff. 6/4/2011)
SEC. 1602.*  DEFINITIONS.
	Unless the context requires otherwise, the following definitions shall govern the construction of this Article:
	(a)	"City" means the City and County of San Francisco.
	(b)	"Debris and Waste Construction Material" includes any wood, brick, plaster, glass, cement, roofing material, composite, sheet rock, sheet metal, wire, pipe and other materials related to the remodeling, construction or repair of, or the partial or total demolition of, houses, buildings or other structures.
	(c)	"Director" means the Director of the Department of Public Works or his or her designee.
	(d)	"Person" means and includes companies, corporations, limited liability companies, estates, associations, partnerships, trusts, unincorporated associations and one or more individual human beings.
	(e)	"Prevailing Party" has the same meaning as set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 1032, or any successor provision. "Prevailing Party" includes the City in actions where the City obtains an injunction and/or civil penalties or other monies under this Article or State law.
	(f)	"Public Property" includes any portion of a street, road, right-of-way, sidewalk, park, lot, or public or other land owned, operated, leased, or maintained by the City and County of San Francisco.
	(g)	"Responsible Party" includes any Person who causes or allows or contributes to or participates in actions which constitute a nuisance under this Article.
(Added by Ord. 73-11, File No. 110222, App. 5/5/2011, Eff. 6/4/2011)
SEC. 1603.*  PROHIBITED DUMPING ACTIVITY.
	(a)	It shall be prohibited for any Person to deposit, leave, place, keep, maintain, or abandon, Debris and Waste Construction Materials, industrial materials, or more than 100 pounds total of any other waste, refuse, or debris on any Public Property without the lawful and express written permission of the City and County of San Francisco.
	(b)	Any activity or action that violates this Article shall be, and is hereby declared, a public nuisance.
	(c)	Nothing in this Article shall be construed to authorize or allow any Person to deposit, leave, place, keep, maintain, or abandon, any other property or materials, in any amount, on any Public Property without the lawful and express written permission of the City and County of San Francisco, other than to deposit trash in an appropriate designated receptacle.
(Added by Ord. 73-11, File No. 110222, App. 5/5/2011, Eff. 6/4/2011)
SEC. 1604.*  ABATEMENT
	(a)	The Director may require or take any necessary abatement or enforcement action to clean up or contain any material dumped on Public Property, including ordering the Responsible Party to remove and appropriately dispose of the material. The Director may ask any other City department or necessary state agency for assistance in abating any nuisance pursuant to this Article.
	(b)	Any costs or monies expended by the Department of Public Works or any other department of the City and County of San Francisco to abate a nuisance under this Article may be recovered in a civil action as described in Section 1605.
(Added by Ord. 73-11, File No. 110222, App. 5/5/2011, Eff. 6/4/2011)
SEC. 1605.*  ENFORCEMENT  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL PENALTIES, COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.
	(a)	The City Attorney may enforce the provisions of this Article through a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
	(b)	The City Attorney may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order seeking injunctive relief to abate or remove any nuisance described in this Article, to restrain any Responsible Party from taking any action contrary to the provisions of this Article or to require any Responsible Party to take action to comply with the provisions of this Article or an order by the Director to remove and appropriately dispose of material illegally dumped on Public Property.
	(c)	In any civil court action brought by the City Attorney to enforce this Article in which the City succeeds in obtaining any order from the Court, the City shall be entitled to recover from any and all Responsible Parties all of its costs of investigation, enforcement, abatement, and litigation.
		(1)	The City shall be entitled to recover civil penalties from each and every Responsible Party in an amount that is not less than twice the amount it cost the City to abate the nuisance. Costs to the City to abate the nuisance shall include any personnel, equipment, and other charges incurred by the City related to the investigation, abatement, clean-up, and/or containment of Debris and Waste Construction Materials, industrial materials, or more than 100 pounds of any other waste, refuse, or debris dumped on Public Property. This civil penalties provision is designed to compensate the City for any costs it incurred to investigate and abate the unlawful acts of any Responsible Party and for the ancillary health hazards and inconveniences caused to the City and its residents, rights of way blocked, traffic delays or detours, and any personal or business difficulties suffered from the maintenance of illegally dumped materials on Public Property.
		(2)	The Prevailing Party in any court action to abate a nuisance pursuant to this Article shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees.
	(d)	Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as restricting or otherwise limiting the enforcement authority conferred upon other City employees, City agencies, or state agencies by other provisions of the Municipal Code or state law.
	(e)	Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as restricting, precluding or otherwise limiting a separate or concurrent criminal prosecution under the Municipal Code or state law. Jeopardy shall not attach as a result of any court action to abate a nuisance pursuant to this Article.
