* Editorâ€™s Note:
	Refer to Division 2 of the San Francisco City and County Subdivision Code for provisions regulating subdivision of land within the Mission Bay Project Area.
SEC. 1300.  TITLE.
	This Chapter shall be known as the "Subdivision Code of the City and County of San Francisco." 
SEC. 1301.  AUTHORITY AND MANDATE.
	(a)	This Code is adopted pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act of California, Title 7, Division 2 of the Government Code, commencing with Section 66410 (hereinafter referred to as "SMA").
	(b)	Any amendments to SMA, adopted subsequent to the effective date of this Code, shall not invalidate any provisions of this Code. Any amendments to SMA that may be inconsistent with this Code shall govern. 
	(c)	This Code shall govern in relation to all other ordinances of the City and County of San Francisco and rules and regulations pursuant thereto. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this Code and other provisions of the Municipal Code, the most restrictive shall prevail. 
SEC. 1302.  PURPOSES.
	(a)	This Code is enacted to establish procedures and requirements for the control and approval of subdivision development within the City and County of San Francisco in accordance with SMA.
	(b)	This Code is enacted to encourage and ensure the development of subdivisions consistent with the objectives of the San Francisco Master Plan. 
	(c)	Recognizing that, by their unique character and impact on the City's population and housing stock, condominium conversion subdivisions differ from other subdivisions, implementation of Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section requires the adoption of special requirements for conversions, the purposes of which are: 
		(1)	To preserve a reasonable balance of ownership and rental housing within the City and County of San Francisco by providing for an annual limitation on the number of units which may be converted to condominiums in any year. 
		(2)	To promote the meaningful expansion of homeownership opportunities for existing tenants and to prevent the displacement of existing tenants by requiring a high degree of tenant intent to purchase their rental units as a condition of approval. 
		(3)	To reduce the impact of conversions on nonpurchasing tenants who may be required to relocate, by providing for procedures for notification and adequate time and assistance for relocation, and providing for the reimbursement of costs resulting from such relocation. 
		(4)	To prevent the displacement of elderly and disabled tenants by assuring them of extended leases to remain in their units subsequent to conversion. 
		(5)	To assure that purchasers of converted housing have been properly informed as to the physical condition of the structure which is offered for purchase. 
		(6)	To prevent the effective loss of the City's low or moderate income housing stock by requiring sales price limitations on those units proposed for conversion which are found to be part of the low or moderate income housing stock. 
		(7)	To expand the supply of the City's low or moderate income housing stock by provision of a minimum of 10 percent low or moderate income housing units in any condominium subdivision, or by construction of an equivalent number of such units elsewhere, or by in-lieu payments into a City housing development fund. 
(Amended by Ord. 337-79, App. 7/6/79; Ord. 161-01, File No. 010891, App. 7/9/2001; Ord. 281-04, File No. 041353, App. 12/1/2004)
SEC. 1302A.  FAIR HOUSING REQUIREMENTS.
	When making any decision regarding the control or approval of subdivision development within the City and County of San Francisco which includes "dwellings" as defined in Chapter 87 of the San Francisco Administrative Code, the applicable City department or official shall comply with that Chapter which requires, among other things, that the applicable City department or official not base any decision regarding the development of "dwellings" in which "protected class" members are likely to reside on information which may be discriminatory to any member of a "protected class" (as all such terms are defined in Chapter 87 of the San Francisco Administrative Code).
(Added by Ord. 308-99, File No. 990499, App. 12/3/99)
SEC. 1303.  SCOPE.
	(a)	This Code supplements SMA, prescribing rules, regulations and procedures authorized therein.
	(b)	The necessity for Tentative Maps, Final Maps and Parcel Maps shall be governed by this Section and SMA.
	(c)	For subdivisions creating five or more parcels or units, a Tentative Map and a Final Map or Parcel Map shall be required pursuant to this Code and SMA. 
		(1)	A Tentative Map and a Final Map shall be required for all such subdivisions except those coming within the exceptions set forth in Section 66426 of SMA. 
		(2)	A Tentative Map and a Parcel Map shall be required for all such subdivisions coming within the exceptions set forth in Section 66426 of SMA. 
	(d)	For subdivisions creating fewer than five parcels or units, no Tentative Map shall be required except as provided in Section 1333.1(a) with respect to vesting tentative maps. In all subdivisions creating fewer than five parcels or units where the subdivider does not choose to file a vesting other Tentative Map, a Parcel Map containing the information specified by Section 1359 of this Code and SMA shall be required. Said Parcel Map shall be filed with the City Engineer and recorded according to the procedure set forth in Sections 1360 through 1364 of this Code. 
	(e)	No Tentative Map, Final Map or Parcel Map shall be required for those specific types of subdivision exempted by Sections 66412 and 66428 of SMA; provided, however, that with respect to subdivisions described in Subsection (h) of Section 66412 of the SMA, certification pursuant to the provisions of Section 1397 must be obtained. 
	(f)	The Director of Public Works shall waive the requirement of a Parcel Map for any improved or unimproved land shown on the latest equalized County assessment roll as contiguous units or parcels where the units or parcels have been subdivided legally and comply with the requirements as to lot width and area, improvement and design, floodwater drainage control, appropriate improved public roads, sanitary disposal facilities, water supply availability and environmental protection.

	(b)	All departments, officials and public employees of the City, vested with the duty or authority to approve or issue permits, shall conform to the provisions of this Code and shall neither approve nor issue any permit or license for use, construction, or purpose in conflict with the provisions of this Code.

Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder. 
	(d)	The Director of Public Works shall have the authority to enforce this Code against violations thereof by any of the following actions: 
		(1)	The Director may serve notice requiring the cessation or correction of any action in violation of this Code upon the subdivider, agent of the subdivider, successor in interest of the subdivider, tenant, purchaser, builder, contractor or other person who commits or assists in such violation;

The prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs pursuant to order of the Court. The remedy available under this subsection shall be in addition to any other existing remedies which may be available to the tenant or tenants. 
(Amended by Ord. 86-81, App. 2/20/81)
SEC. 1305.  SEVERABILITY.
	(a)	If any Article, Section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code, or any part thereof, is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, or other competent agency, such decisions shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Code or any part thereof. The Board of Supervisors hereby declares that it would have passed each Article, Section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more Articles, Sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective.
	(b)	If the application of any provisions or provisions of this Code to any person, property or circumstances is found to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, or other competent agency, the effect of such decision shall be limited to the person, property or circumstances immediately involved in the controversy and the application of any such provisions to other persons, properties and circumstances shall not be affected.

SEC. 1341.  LOW AND MODERATE INCOME OCCUPANCY.
	The provisions of this Section and its application to certain properties may be affected by amendments creating Section 1344. Please consult Section 1344 in addition to this Section for Units subject to the Below Market Rate Condominium Conversion Program.
	(a)	In all subdivisions involving 50 or more lots or units, except for condominium or cooperative conversion subdivisions, the subdivider shall make available 10 percent of the units for low and moderate income occupancy provided that the Department of City Planning finds that governmental subsidies for such occupancy are available to the subdivider. This requirement shall not limit the authority of the City otherwise to encourage the provision of low and moderate income housing, or of the subdivider to make available additional low and moderate income housing. 
	(b)	In all condominium or cooperative conversion subdivisions with five or more lots or units, the subdivider shall make available 10 percent of the lots or units for rental or for purchase by households of low or moderate income. In the event that the total number of units determined to be within the low or moderate income housing stocks pursuant to Section 1385 is greater that 10 percent of the total number of units in the subdivision, such greater number shall apply, and such number of units determined to be within the low or moderate income housing stock shall be made available for purchase as set forth in Section 1385, thereby precluding the application of the alternatives set forth in Section 1341 to such number of units. In the event the total number of units determined to be within the low or moderate income housing stock pursuant to Section 1385 is less than 10 percent of the total number of units in the subdivision, the difference between such number of units determined to be within the low or moderate income housing stock and the 10 percent required by Section 1341 may be satisfied by the alternatives set forth in this Section. 
	(c)	If the units are to be made available for purchase, then the sales prices of such units shall not exceed 2.5 times the annual median income for low or moderate income households, as defined, and as adjusted for household size according to the relationship to the size of the dwelling, as set forth in Section 1309. Priority for purchase of these units shall be as set forth in Section 1385. Any low or moderate income household which purchases a dwelling pursuant to this Section shall grant a right-of-first-refusal, to the City and County of San Francisco, or to such other entity that at a future time may be designated by the City and County of San Francisco, to repurchase the dwelling from the initial purchaser at the original price plus the cost of any improvements paid for by the owner, plus an increase proportionate to the increases in the housing component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," over the intervening time period. The City and County of San Francisco, or designated agent, shall reconvey such unit to other qualified purchasers if the right to purchase is exercised by the City or its designated agent. 
	(d)	If the converted units are to be for rental, then the rent in such units shall not exceed the rent charged at the time of filing the application for conversion, or the maximum rent that would be allowed so as to keep the unit within moderate income housing stock, whichever rent level is lower. Once established, rent levels for any units remaining as rental pursuant to this Section may be increased annually consistent with any changes in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor." In cases of hardship to the subdivider, or in cases where a rent increase authorized herein is considered by the tenant to be not consistent with increases in the residential rent component of the Bay Area Cost of Living Index, either a subdivider or a tenant may request relief under this Section from the Director or his or her designee. In considering the reasonableness of a rent increase, the Director shall consider whether the rental revenues are sufficient to adequately maintain the building in safe and sound condition, and in conformity with any applicable sections of the San Francisco Housing and Building Codes. The Director may allow rent increases greater than the proportionate increases in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," in order to allow the building to be maintained in safe and sound condition. The rental increase provisions of this Section shall apply only in the absence of other applicable rent increase or arbitration laws. 
	(e)	Converted units made available for purchase by households of low or moderate income pursuant to this Section, or purchased by a tenant or qualified household subject to the price limitation of Section 1385, shall remain within the low or moderate income housing stock pursuant to the recapture provision of Subsection (c) above. Units made available for rental pursuant to Subsection (d) above shall remain as rental units for no less than 20 years, provided, however, that such rental units may be sold by the original subdivider or any subsequent owner during such 20-year period at a price not exceeding the price at which the City and County of San Francisco would be entitled to repurchase the unit if exercising its right of first refusal under Subsection (c) above, and further provided that such maximum price shall not reflect the cost of any improvements made within two years after recording of the final or parcel map for the conversion. 
	(f)	As an alternative to the provisions of Subsections (b) and (c) above, the subdivider shall make a bona fide agreement, satisfactory to the Department of City Planning, to construct or cause to be constructed within a period commencing 18 months prior to the date of filing the application for conversion and ending 18 months after filing of the final or parcel map, or to provide through other means, the same number of units and under the same conditions as would be required for low or moderate income occupancy under the provisions of Subsections (b), (c) and (d) above, in areas approved by the Department of City Planning as being non-impacted with assisted housing. 
	(g)	As a further alternative to the provisions of Subsections (b), (c) and (f) above, the subdivider shall pay to the City and County of San Francisco an amount equal to 10 percent of the difference between the aggregated total of the proposed market rate sales prices, as indicated on the price list supplied with the application packet, and the aggregate total of the sales prices if the units were to be sold at moderate-income sales prices, as determined by the sales price formula of Section 1385 and Subsection (c) above. This payment shall be made within two years of the recordation of the Final Map. 
	(h)	Funds collected pursuant to Subsection (g) above, shall be deposited into the Housing Development Fund, which fund is to be used for persons and households of low or moderate income.

	(a)	Application.

	(d)	Capital improvements.
		(1)	BMR Units purchased or acquired on or after the effective date of this ordinance. The Capital Improvements Policy for this Program is contained in the Procedures Manual, on file with the Clerk of the Board in File No. 080520 and available on MOH's website. The Policy shall include a per unit cap of 10% of the resale price in order to maintain affordability and shall be consistent with the policy for the Residential Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program, Planning Code Sections 315 et seq.
		(2)	BMR Units purchased or acquired before the effective date of this ordinance. MOH shall continue to use the 1993 Capital Improvements Policy, on file with the Clerk of the Board in File No. 080520 and available on the Mayor's Office of Housing website, to implement the requirements of Section 1341(c) and shall publish the Policy on its website.
	(e)	Sale Procedures.
		(1)	Purchasers. MOH shall insure that all BMR Units conveyed under this Program are sold or transferred to households that qualify as both (A) low- or moderate-income households, depending on how the BMR Unit is designated, as defined; and (B) a First Time Homebuyer household. MOH shall give preference as provided in Subsection (5) below and shall follow the procedures set forth in the Procedures Manual.
		(2)	Duration and Monitoring of Affordability. As provided by Sections 1341 and 1385 BMR Units restricted under this Program are to remain affordable for the life of the BMR Unit. MOH shall insure the BMR Units remain affordable through the following mechanisms. Nothing in this legislation shall preclude the Mayor's Office of Housing from instituting additional mechanisms to insure affordability through the Procedures Manual.
			(A)	BMR Units purchased or acquired on or after the effective date of this legislation. MOH shall require all BMR Units subject to this Program to record a Notice of Special Restrictions with the Recorder of the City and County of San Francisco. The Notice of Special Restrictions must incorporate the procedures for resale or transfer, affordability restrictions, and other requirements of this Program and provide that the owner or tenant shall adhere to the marketing, monitoring, and enforcement procedures outlined in the Procedures Manual, as amended from time to time, in effect at the time of sale. MOH shall maintain records of the applicable Procedures Manual for each BMR Unit transferred or resold under this Program. The Procedures Manual will be referenced in the Notice of Special Restrictions for each BMR Unit.
			(B)	BMR Units purchased or acquired before the effective date of this legislation. The Mayor's Office of Housing has a right of first refusal. MOH shall exercise this right of first refusal at sale consistent with the provisions of Section 1341 and 1341B. In addition, for some BMR Units, a Notice of Special Restrictions (NSR) was recorded against the BMR Unit. For those BMR Units, the provisions in subsection (A) apply. For some BMR Units, the conditions of approval for the project require that an NSR be recorded, but no NSR has yet been recorded. For these BMR Units, the Planning Department and the Mayor's Office of Housing shall work with the owner to insure that the owner records an NSR and thereafter, the provisions in subsection (A) shall apply.
		(3)	Marketing the BMR Units. The Mayor's Office of Housing shall be responsible for overseeing and monitoring the marketing of BMR Units under this Section. In general, the marketing requirements and procedures shall encourage an open public marketing strategy and will be contained in the Procedures Manual, as amended from time to time. The Mayor's Office of Housing may develop occupancy standards for BMR Units of different bedroom sizes in the Procedures Manual in order to promote an efficient allocation of affordable units. The Mayor's Office of Housing may require in the Procedures Manual that prospective purchasers complete homebuyer education training or fulfill other requirements to adequately prepare the buyer for homeownership.
		(4)	Lottery: MOH shall require a general public lottery for all BMR units available for purchase.
			(A)	BMR Units purchased or acquired on or after the effective date of this legislation. The specific procedures for passing a BMR Unit through inheritance are contained in the Procedures Manual. All transfers through inheritance must be reported to and approved by MOH and in all cases, the heir must acknowledge and agree to the provisions of the BMR Program. The following households may inherit the right to occupy a BMR Unit: (i) a spouse or registered domestic partner, regardless of income; (ii) a child of the owner if it qualifies as a low- or moderate-income household depending on the designation of the Unit. Consistent with the provisions herein related to owners who acquire BMR Units after the effective date of this legislation, any heir must owner occupy the Unit. If the heir chooses not to occupy the Unit, the heir may market and sell the Unit at the BMR Price through a public lottery process. The heir will retain the proceeds of the sale.
			(B)	BMR Units purchased or acquired before the effective date of this ordinance. An owner may pass on the right to occupy a Unit through inheritance to a specific household as long as that household agrees to owner-occupy the BMR Unit. If the household chooses not to owner-occupy the Unit, it may sell the Unit at its restricted price consistent with the provisions of this legislation and receive the proceeds of the sale. All transfers through inheritance must be reported to and approved by MOH and in all cases, the heir must acknowledge and agree to the provisions of the BMR Program.
		(5)	Preferences. The Mayor's Office of Housing shall give first priority to an existing tenant of a BMR Unit at the time of sale if that tenant qualifies as a low or moderate income household, depending on how the BMR Unit is designated. If there is no existing qualifying tenant who wishes to purchase the BMR Unit, the Mayor's Office of Housing shall use a lottery system that gives preference to households who live or work in San Francisco and meet all other homebuyer requirements. Otherwise, it is the policy of the Board of Supervisors to treat all households equally in allocating affordable BMR Units under this Program.
	(f)	Rental Procedures.
		(1)	BMR Units purchased or acquired on or after the effective date of this ordinance. All owners purchasing or acquiring BMR Units on or after the effective date of this legislation must owner-occupy the BMR Unit. No rental of such BMR Units shall be permitted without the express written consent of MOH and under the circumstances outlined in the Procedures Manual.
		(2)	BMR Units purchased or acquired before the effective date of this ordinance.
		Renting is permitted under the following conditions. The owner may continue to rent the BMR Unit to an income qualified tenant at an affordable rent, as defined. The owner may continue to rent to the current tenant at the current rent level until the tenant vacates, at which time the owner must notify MOH of their intent to re-rent the Unit. The owner and MOH shall follow the rental procedures as set forth in the Procedures Manual. Additionally, the owner must submit a monitoring report to the Mayor's Office of Housing (MOH), at a timeframe determined by MOH, to verify current tenant information and rent levels. For current owners only, the Board hereby supersedes the requirement of Section 1341B effective June 1, 1988 that BMR Units in this Program be owner-occupied.
	(g)	Other regulations: This Section 1344 sets forth the current requirements and procedures for the Condominium Conversion Below Market Rate Program ("Program"). To implement this Section, the Mayor's Office of Housing shall periodically publish a Procedures Manual containing procedures for monitoring and enforcement of the policies and procedures for implementation of this Program. The Procedures Manual must be made available upon request and on the Mayor's Office of Housing website. The Procedures Manual shall not be amended, except for an annual update of the affordability housing guidelines, which reflect updated income limits, prices, and rents, without approval of the Planning Commission or as otherwise specified herein.
		The Procedures Manual in effect at the time of the most recent owner's purchase of a BMR Unit shall govern the regulation of that BMR Unit until it is transferred or sold. Any future amendments to the Procedures Manual will not be retroactive and will only apply to new owners of BMR Units, unless the owner chooses an alternative that provides otherwise under Section 1344(i).
	(h)	Original Subdividers. The following provisions shall apply only to Original Subdividers as defined herein.
		(1)	The Mayor's Office of Housing shall release any BMR rental units if an Original Subdivider can demonstrate a 20-year rental history at the affordable rate for the unit size and income designation of the Unit. A release of the restrictions under the Program will be recorded against the property. The standards used to determine rental history at the affordable rate for the unit size and income designation of the Unit are found on file with the Clerk of the Board in File No. 080520 and on the Mayor's Office of Housing website.
		(2)	If an Original Subdivider cannot demonstrate 20 years of rental at the affordable rate for the unit size and income designation of the Unit, the Original Subdivider may;
			(A)	Continue to rent the Units until a 20-year rental history at the affordable rate for the unit size and income designation of the Unit can be demonstrated. The Units shall be governed by the rules in Section 1344(f)(2). The standards used to determine rental history at the affordable rate for the unit size and income designation of the Unit are found on file with the Clerk of the Board in File No. and on the Mayor's Office of Housing website.
			(B)	Enter into an agreement with the City, acting through the Mayor's Office of Housing, to pay a housing replacement fee adjusted for income level and number of bedrooms as provided in the table below, or 50% of the difference between the BMR Resale Price and the Fair Market Value at the time of payment, as defined herein, whichever is less, The fee may be paid immediately upon execution of the Agreement or as a City lien, recorded through a note and deed of trust in favor of the City against the property, with a simple interest of 3%. Interest will not start accruing until the date which is 24 months from the effective date of this ordinance. Fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the BMR Resale Price and the Fair Market Value will be established at the time of repayment. Upon payment of the fee or recordation of a lien in favor of the City, a release of the restrictions under the Program will be recorded against the property. As part of any Agreement under this subsection, the Original Subdivider must waive all claims against the City for damages or other alleged injury arising from the Subdivider's participation in the Program. The fee shall be as follows:
Unit SizeModerate Income Designation
(120% AMI)Low Income Designation

SEC. 1383.  CONFORMITY OF HOUSING, BUILDING AND PLANNING CODES.
	As a condition of Final Map approval, the subdivider must demonstrate that all applicable provisions of the City's Housing, Building and City Planning Codes have been met and that all violations of such codes have been satisfactorily corrected or, upon the approval of the Director, and prior to recordation of the Final Map or Parcel Map, funds have been adequately escrowed or bonded to assure completion of such corrective work prior to the closing of escrow of any unit in the project.
SEC. 1385.  PRESERVATION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING.
	The provisions of this Section and its application to certain properties may be affected by amendments creating Section 1344. Please consult Section 1344 in addition to this Section for Units subject to the Below Market Rate Condominium Conversion Program.
	The Department of City Planning shall determine whether any units to be converted are part of the City's low and moderate income housing stocks. If the Department of City Planning determines that any unit to be converted is part of the City's low or moderate income housing stocks, then the price of the unit upon conversion shall not be such as to remove if effectively from said low or moderate income housing stocks and shall be no greater than 2.5 times the highest income level for low and moderate income households as defined in Section 1309(e) and (f), and as adjusted for household size according to the size of the dwelling, as set forth in Sections 1309(1) and (m). The resulting sales prices established pursuant to this formula may be increased consistent with any increases in the housing component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," during the period between the most recent establishment of the above highest income levels and the date of commencement of sales. If the tenant does not exercise the contract right to purchase the unit which has been determined to be part of the low or moderate income housing stock, then the unit shall be made available exclusively for purchase by qualified households of low or moderate income on first-come, first-served basis for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of the decision by the tenant not to exercise the contract right to purchase or, if there is no tenant, from the date of issuance of the State Department of Real Estate Final Subdivision Public Report, at a price no greater than that allowed under the low and moderate income price guidelines set forth above. Priority, however, shall be given to low or moderate income households who can demonstrate that they had previously relocated from a dwelling in a building which has been approved for condominium conversion. The alternatives for low and moderate income occupancy set forth in Section 1341 shall not apply, except for those additional number of units which may be required pursuant to Section 1341(a) to be made available for rental or for purchase by households of low or moderate income. In cases where no low or moderate income household has purchased or contracted to purchase such unit within this 12-month period, after good-faith efforts by the subdivider, the subdivider may offer the unit to the general public with no price limitation.
(Amended by Ord. 45-82, App. 2/11/82; Ord. 257-88, App. 6/22/88; Ord. 320-08, File No. 080520, App. 12/19/2008)
SEC. 1385A.  SUSPENSION OF PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1385.
	(1)	The provisions of Section 1385 shall not apply to applications for initial conversion of residential units filed on or after June 1, 1988. For purposes of this Section initial conversion shall mean the first time the parcel containing the subject units is converted to condominiums.
	(2)	The suspension of Section 1385 shall continue so long as the 200 unit annual conversion limit set forth in Section 1396 remains in effect.
(Added by Ord. 257-88, App. 6/22/88)
SEC. 1386.  DENIAL OF TENTATIVE MAP.
	When the City Planning Commission determines that vacancies in the project have been increased, or elderly or permanently disabled tenants displaced or discriminated against in leasing units, or evictions have occurred for the purpose of preparing the building for conversion, or if rents in the project over the previous 18 months preceding the date of filing the application have been increased substantially greater than any increase in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," (except for increases reasonably related to construction of Code-required capital improvements directly related to Code enforcement, or to recoup the costs thereof), or when the City Planning Commission determines that the subdivider has knowingly submitted incorrect information (to mislead or misdirect efforts by agencies of the City and County of San Francisco in the administration of this Code), the Tentative Map shall be disapproved and the subdivider may not reapply for 18 months from the date of denial. In evaluation of the current vacancy level under this Section, the increase in rental rates for each unit over the preceding five years and the average monthly vacancy rate for the project over the preceding three years shall be considered. In the evaluation of displacement of elderly tenants any such displacements over the preceding three years, and the reasons therefor, shall be considered.
(Amended by Ord. 86-81, App. 2/20/81)
SEC. 1387.  RIGHT OF TENANTS TO CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF UNIT.
	(a)	The present tenant or tenants at the date of filing of the application for a Tentative Map of any unit to be converted or, in the event of a voluntary vacation, or eviction for cause, the tenant or tenants in occupancy at the date of issuance of the State Department of Real Estate's Final Subdivision Public Report shall be given a nontransferable contract right to purchase the unit occupied at a price no greater than the price offered to the general public.
	(b)	The right of contract for purchase of the unit shall extend for 60 days from the date the unit is initially offered to the tenant in writing by the subdivider. The period of acceptance of the offer may be extended if such an agreement is executed in writing by the subdivider and tenant, provided that the tenant may cancel the purchase agreement if the unit is not conveyed to that tenant within six months of the agreement to purchase.
	(c)	The offer of sale may not be extended by the subdivider to the tenant until the recordation of the Final Map or Parcel Map, and until the issuance of the State Department of Real Estate's Final Subdivision Public Report.
SEC. 1388.  TENANT INTENT TO PURCHASE.
	No application for conversion shall be approved unless there are substantial numbers of tenants who have indicated their intent to purchase their rental unit. This intent shall be evidenced by the submittal in writing by no less than 40 percent of the tenants of intent to purchase forms, as provided by the Department of Public Works. In obtaining or soliciting intent to purchase forms from tenants, subdividers shall comply with any restrictions set forth in the California Business and Professions Code and Regulations of the Real Estate Commissioner. In calculating the total number of units necessary to satisfy this provision, there shall be included in the 40 percent requirement any units in which the occupant qualified for and has expressed an intent to obtain a renewable lifetime lease pursuant to Section 1391(c).
	Any tenant intent to purchase forms obtained by way of an inducement of the subdivider to provide benefits to that tenant beyond those established by the Code shall be so identified and the specific representations of the subdivider shall be set forth in detail. All such intent to purchase forms shall become a matter of public record and the subdivider shall be required to comply with his or her representations as conditions of approval.
	The intent to purchase forms, once signed by a tenant, shall be irrevocable by said tenant, for purposes of compliance with this Section, provided, however, that the Director shall invalidate any such form upon a determination that the subdivider has used coercion, fraud, duress, misrepresentation or threat in connection with obtaining or soliciting such form.
(Amended by Ord. 161-01, File No. 010891, App. 7/9/2001; Ord. 281-04, File No. 041353, App. 12/1/2004)
SEC. 1389.  TEMPORARY RELOCATION OF TENANTS.
	If temporary relocation of any tenant is necessary for renovation of a unit between the date of submission of the Tentative Map and the date established for permanent relocation, then the subdivider shall find equivalent substitute housing for that tenant for the period of renovation, and shall pay to that tenant any additional cost of the substitute housing. Any tenant temporarily relocated shall have the right to return to his or her former unit until the expiration of all rights granted to such tenant as provided in this Code.
SEC. 1390.  RENT INCREASE LIMITATION.
	The rent to tenants at the time of filing the application for conversion shall not be increased for the period between the filing of the application until relocation takes place or until the subdivision is denied or withdrawn, except that such period shall not exceed two years. At the end of such period, and for one-year period thereafter, any increase in rent shall not exceed the proportionate increase in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," over that period of time, provided, that the rental increase provisions of this section shall be operative only in the absence of other rent increase or arbitration laws. In cases of hardship due to unusual circumstances to the subdivider, or in cases where a rent increase authorized herein is considered by the tenant to be not consistent with increases in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," either a subdivider or a tenant may request relief under this Section from the Director of Public Works or his or her designee. In considering the reasonableness of a rent increase, the Director shall consider the current rent paid for comparable units in comparable areas.
SEC. 1391.  VACATION OF UNITS: STATUTORY NOTICE OF EVICTION REQUIRED; EXTENSION OF LEASES FOR ELDERLY TENANTS.
	(a)	Except for tenants availing themselves of the lease option set forth below, each nonpurchasing tenant shall be given 120 days from the date of receipt of notification from the subdivider of the intent to convert (as required in California Government Code Section 60427.1) to find substitute housing and to relocate. The subdivider shall not transmit such notice, however, prior to recordation of the Final Map or Parcel Map. If any tenant has a lease to occupy a unit in which the term of said lease extends longer than the 120-day period provided herein, such tenant shall not be evicted except for cause until the expiration of such lease.
		Each nonpurchasing tenant shall be given the option of entering into or renewing a lease agreement to occupy said tenant's dwelling unit for period of up to one year following the date of approval of the Final Map; the rental charge and rights and obligations of the parties during said period shall be in accordance with Subsection (c) of this Section.
	(b)	Upon expiration of all such time requirements and upon satisfaction of any conditions required for conformity with the Master Plan, including the recordation of the Final Map or Parcel Map, the tenant shall also be entitled to the statutory period for notice of eviction as provided in California Civil Code Section 1946.
		This provision shall not affect the requirement that a tenant receive relocation services and reimbursements for moving expenses provided that the tenant request and be eligible for said services as provided in Section 1392 and Section 1393, and provided that the time for relocation assistance not extend beyond the 120-day period of the notice of intent to convert or any lease extension as required in Subsection (a) of this Section.
	(c)	No subdivider or subsequent condominium unit owner shall refuse to renew a lease or extend a rental agreement to any nonpurchasing tenant aged 62 or older at the time of recordation; of the Final Map or Parcel Map, or any tenant permanently disabled. Any extended leases or rental agreements made pursuant hereto shall expire only upon the death or demise of such tenant or the last surviving member of the tenant's household, provided such surviving member is related to the tenant by blood or marriage and is aged 62 or older at the time of death or demise of such tenant, or at such time as the tenant voluntarily vacates the unit after giving due notice of such intent to vacate. Each lease shall contain a provision allowing the tenant to terminate the lease and vacate the unit upon 30 days' notice. Rent charged during the term of any extended lease or rental agreement pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall not exceed the rent charged at the time of filing of the application for conversion, plus any increases proportionate to the increases in the residential rent component of the "Bay Area Cost of Living Index, U.S. Dept. of Labor," provided that the rental increase provisions of this Section shall be operative only in the absence of other applicable rent increase or arbitration laws. This Section shall not alter or abridge the rights or obligations of the parties in performance of their covenants, including but not limited to the provision of services, payment of rent or the obligations imposed by Sections 1941, 1941.1 and 1941.2 of the California Civil Code. There shall be no decrease in dwelling unit maintenance or other services historically provided to such units and such tenants.
SEC. 1392.  SUBDIVIDER TO PROVIDE MOVING EXPENSES.
	(a)	The subdivider shall bear the cost of moving expenses of any tenant who relocates from the building to be converted. The tenant, at his or her option, shall be reimbursed either for the actual moving expenses up to a maximum of $1,000, or for the fixed amount allowed by the moving expense schedule of the Central Relocation Services agency. In the event the unit is occupied by a subtenant under an agreement with the tenant, the moving expense reimbursement herein provided shall be shared proportionately by both parties in relation to the actual costs of moving the property of each party.
	(b)	Availability for such assistance shall be limited to the 120-day period or the period of any lease extension as provided in Section 1391(a) unless a contrary agreement is reached by the subdivider and tenant; provided that tenants aged 62 years or older, or permanently disabled whose tenancy is extended pursuant to Section 1391(c), would be eligible for such assistance at such time that such tenant elects to voluntarily vacate the unit and gives due notice therefor.
	(c)	Those parties who lease a unit subsequent to the date of filing the application for conversion shall not be eligible to receive assistance provided in this Section unless such an agreement is made between the subdivider and prospective tenant.
SEC. 1393.  SUBDIVIDER TO PROVIDE RELOCATION ASSISTANCE.
	(a)	Any tenant who requests assistance in finding relocation housing shall be referred to the Central Relocations Services Agency of the City and County of San Francisco, or, with the mutual consent of the tenant and subdivider, such assistance may be provided by the subdivider or a real estate brokerage firm selected by the subdivider. The subdivider shall bear any costs to the tenant of such assistance in finding relocation housing.
	(b)	Availability for such assistance shall be limited to the expiration of the 120-day period or the period of any lease as provided in Section 1391(a) and (c), unless a contrary agreement is reached by the subdivider and tenant.
	(c)	Those parties who lease a unit subsequent to the date of filing the application for conversion shall not be eligible to receive assistance provided in this Section unless such an agreement is made between the subdivider and prospective tenant.
SEC. 1394.  TIME LIMITS FOR REAPPLICATION.
	(a)	In the event an application for condominium conversion subdivision is withdrawn by the applicant, said application may not be resubmitted for six months from the date of withdrawal.
	(b)	In the event an application for condominium conversion subdivision is denied, or a Tentative Map is disapproved, the applicant therefor may not submit a new application for the same building for one year from the date of such denial, except that this period may be extended pursuant to the provisions of Section 1386.
SEC. 1395.  TIME LIMITS FOR SALE.

	(e)	Commencing with the 1997 lottery, any building seeking more than one lottery ticket shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that one or more of the qualified owners of the building were owners of the building at the time of the lotteries in which the building participated but failed to be selected for conversion.
	(f)	For purposes of determining whether a building failed to be selected for conversion in a previous lottery:
		(1)	Those buildings which were chosen in a previous lottery but were not converted for any reason whatsoever shall not be considered as having failed to be selected in that lottery.
		(2)	Any previous failures to be selected by lottery do not have to occur in consecutive years.
		(3)	No credit shall be given for any year in which the building did not participate in the lottery.
	(g)	In addition to the other provisions relating to Pool A and Pool B described in subsections (b) through (f) above:

SEC. 1396.3.  ANNUAL CONVERSION LIMITATION LOTTERY PROCEDURES BASED ON SENIORITY OF PARTICIPATION.
	This Section shall govern conduct of the lottery required by Section 1396 and shall prevail over the lottery selection process of Section 1396.1 for the conversion of residential units.
	(a)	The lottery shall be comprised of two pools (Pool A and Pool B).
	(b)	Pool A.
		(1)	Pool A shall consist of only those eligible buildings which participated but which have failed to be selected for conversion in at least three previous lotteries. In addition, Pool A eligibility requires that each applicant for the lottery certify under penalty of perjury, and the Department must verify with the Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board, and with the Human Rights Commission as applicable, that since January 1, 2000, no eviction as defined in San Francisco Administrative Code Section 37.9(a)(8) â€“ (14) of a senior, disabled person, or catastrophically ill tenant as defined below has occurred, or if an eviction has taken place under Administrative Code Section 37.9(a)(11) or (14), that the original tenant reoccupied the unit after a temporary eviction. For purposes of this section a "senior" shall be a person who is 60 years or older and has been residing in the unit for 10 years or more at the time of the lottery; a "disabled" tenant is defined for purposes of this Section as a person who is disabled within the meaning of Title 42 U.S.C. Section 12102(2)(A); and a "catastrophically ill" tenant is defined for purposes of this Subsection as a person who is disabled as defined above, and who is suffering from a life threatening illness as certified by his or her primary care physician. If an applicant for Pool A cannot satisfy this certification requirement, the applicant shall participate in Pool B as set forth in Subsections (c) â€“ (g). This certification also is subject to the procedures of Subsection (g)(4). If all buildings eligible in Pool A comprise 100 or fewer units, all such buildings shall automatically be approved for conversion. Any unallocated units in Pool A shall be added to Pool B.
		(2)	If all buildings eligible in Pool A comprise more than 100 units, the Director of the Department of Public Works (Director) rank the buildings according to the number of times a building has participated in and failed to be selected in any lottery, to be known as a Class. The Director shall enter the buildings having participated the most times into the Senior Class. If the total number of units in the Senior Class exceeds 100 units, then the Director shall conduct a lottery among all the buildings eligible for the Senior Class so that no more than 100 units are selected for conversion in Pool A. If the total number of units in the Senior Class is fewer than 100 units, all buildings shall automatically be approved for conversion. If there are remaining units to be selected to reach the maximum total of 100 units in Pool A, the process will then proceed to the next most senior Class. If the next most senior Class would result in more than 100 total units being selected in Pool A, then the Director shall conduct a lottery among all the buildings eligible for the next most senior Class so that no more than 100 total units are selected for conversion in Pool A. If the number of units in next most senior Class(es) combined with the units previously selected in Pool A is fewer than 100 total units, all buildings in the next most senior Class shall automatically be approved for conversion. If there are remaining units to be selected to reach the maximum total of 100 units in Pool A, the process will then proceed as described above for the next most senior Class so that those buildings with the most seniority are prioritized over the junior Class(es). At such time as the number of units in the Class next eligible for conversion exceeds the total number of units remaining for selection in Pool A, a lottery will be held among that Class to determine which units shall be selected for conversion as part of Pool A. All buildings not selected for conversion through the Pool A lottery shall then participate in Pool B, under the procedures set forth below.
	(c)	Pool B.
		(1)	Pool B shall consist of all eligible buildings pursuant to Section 1396 above, together with any buildings from Pool A that were not selected for conversion in the Pool A lottery.
		(2)	Buildings from Pool B shall be selected for conversion by random selection of lottery tickets submitted for eligible buildings.
		(3)	Each building in Pool B shall receive one lottery ticket for the current lottery, plus one lottery ticket for every lottery in which the building participated but failed to be selected for conversion.
	(d)	Applicants shall provide proof of participation in past lotteries to the Director.
		(1)	Proof of participation in any lottery held during the years 1990 through 1994 shall be as follows:
			(i)	Presentation by the registrant of a letter of regret from the Director for any lottery held during the years 1990 through 1994; or
			(ii)	Presentation by the registrant of a cancelled check for payment of lottery registration fees from any lottery held during the years 1990 through 1994; or
			(iii)	Any other proof of participation in any lottery held during the years 1990 through 1994, as determined acceptable by the Director.
		(2)	Proof of participation in any lottery held in or after 1995 shall be determined upon presentation by the registrant of a letter of regret from the Director.
	(e)	Commencing with the 1997 lottery, any building seeking more than one lottery ticket shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the required number of qualified owners of the building were owners of the building at the time of the lotteries in which the building participated but failed to be selected for conversion.
	(f)	For purposes of determining whether a building failed to be selected for conversion in a previous lottery:
		(1)	Those buildings which were chosen in a previous lottery but were not converted for any reason whatsoever shall not be considered as having failed to be selected in that lottery.
		(2)	Any previous failures to be selected by lottery do not have to occur in consecutive years.
		(3)	No credit shall be given for any year in which the building did not participate in the lottery.
	(g)	In addition to the other provisions relating to Pool A and Pool B described in subsections (b) through (f) above:
		(1)	The first 175 units selected by lottery in Pools A and B must meet the following requirements: the Applicant for the lottery must certify under penalty of perjury and the Department must verify with the Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board, and with the Human Rights Commission as applicable, that since November 16, 2004, no eviction as defined in San Francisco Administrative Code Section 37.9(a)(8) â€“ (14) of a senior, disabled person, or catastrophically ill tenant as defined below has occurred, or if an eviction has taken place under Administrative Code Section 37.9(a)(11) or (14), that the original tenant reoccupied the unit after a temporary eviction. For purposes of this section a "senior" shall be a person who is 60 years or older and has been residing in the unit for 10 years or more at the time of the lottery; a "disabled" tenant is defined for purposes of this Section as a person who is disabled within the meaning of Title 42 U.S.C. Section 12102(2)(A); and a "catastrophically ill" tenant is defined for purposes of this Subsection as a person who is disabled as defined above, and who is suffering from a life threatening illness as certified by his or her primary care physician.
		(2)	If there are not 175 units that meet the requirements of subsection (g)(1) above, then the remaining units will not be awarded by lottery in that year's lottery or any future lottery. If there are more than 175 units that meet the requirements of subsection (g)(1) above, then those units may compete for the remaining 25 units as described in subsection (g)(3) below.
		(3)	The remaining 25 units in Pool A and Pool B will be selected as described in subsections (b) through (f) and may, but do not need to, meet the additional requirements of subsection (g)(1) above.
		(4)	If the Department determines that an Applicant has knowingly provided false material information under subsection (g)(1) above, the Department shall immediately deny the application for the lottery, or if the Applicant has submitted an application for conversion, shall immediately deny the application for conversion. Moreover, the Department, the Director or other authorized person or entity may also enforce the provisions of this Section under Section 1304 or any other applicable provision of law as warranted.
	(h)	Standby List.
		(1)	Once all units have been allocated in Pools A and B, the remaining buildings shall be placed on a standby list as set forth in subsection (2). Buildings on the standby list may convert in the event that selected units in Pools A and B are unable to convert within the time limits that the Department establishes and as long as the maximum number of allocated units is not exceeded.
		(2)	The standby list shall be determined by a lottery or, if necessary, a series of lotteries among a Class(es) of buildings prioritized by seniority of participation in the annual condominium conversion lottery. Only buildings satisfying the requirements of subsection (g)(1) shall be assigned to the standby list in the manner specified above. The standby list lottery shall terminate after the Department selects the first 20 buildings.
		(3)	All remaining buildings shall be kept on file with the Department. These buildings are eligible to convert if selected units in Pools A and B and the standby list lottery are unable to convert within the time limits that the Department establishes and as long as the maximum number of allocated units is not exceeded. In such an event, the Department shall conduct a random selection lottery among the remaining buildings for any unallocated units.

		(4)	If the owner(s) of a building subject to the life time lease provisions of this Section 1396.4(g) enters into any contract or option to sell or transfer any unit that would be subject to the lifetime lease requirements or any interest in any unit in the building that would be subject to the lifetime lease requirements at any time between the initial application and recording of the final subdivision map or parcel map, said contract or option shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) the contract or option shall include written notice that the unit shall be subject to the life time lease requirements of Subdivision Code Section 1396.4(g), (b) prior to final execution of any such contract or option, the owner(s) shall record a notice of restrictions against the property that specifically identifies the unit potentially subject to the life time lease requirements and specifies the requirements of the life time lease as set forth in Section 1396.4(g)(1), and (c) the recorded notice of restrictions shall be included as a note on the final subdivision map or parcel map. Prior to approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map, the applicant(s) shall certify under penalty of perjury to the Department that he, she, or they have complied with the terms of this Subsection as it applies to a building.

If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted, any change of use or scope of the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee. If the Board grants a reduction, adjustment or waiver, the Clerk of the Board shall promptly transmit the nature and extent of the reduction, adjustment or waiver to the Treasurer and Department of Public Works.
		(3)	A project applicant may apply to the Department of Public Works for a deferral of payment of the fee described in Subsection (e) for the period that the Department completes its review and until the application for expedited conversion is approved, provided that for the twelve months prior to the application, the applicant resided in his or her unit in the subject property as his or her principle place of residence and the applicant's household income was less than 120% of median income of the City and County of San Francisco as determined by the Mayor's Office of Housing.

	(f)	On or after the date set by the Director for compliance by the applicant with the requirements regarding tenant rights, the applicant shall provide the Department of Public Works with respect to each tenant one of the following:

	(g)	If the applicant has complied with the requirements of this Section governing tenant rights, the Director shall issue the Certificate of Exemption; provided, however, that if any tenant or occupant of the building disputes the validity of that action on the grounds that tenant rights have not been provided as required herein, the Director of a designee shall conduct a hearing, after providing notice to the applicant and the occupant of each unit, in order to determine whether all such rights have been provided. The Certificate of Exemption shall not be issued unless the Director makes the determination that such rights have been provided.

SEC. 1399.1.  PURPOSE.
	This Article 11 is enacted to establish a method for converting parcels containing 2 or more existing residential units into limited equity housing cooperatives. The conversions allowable under this Article 11 are intended to:
	(a)	promote the expansion of residential ownership opportunities for existing tenants by making conversions into limited equity housing cooperatives possible at a level they can afford because limited equity housing cooperatives are widely recognized as vehicles to:
		(1)	provide affordable home ownership opportunities for very low and low-income individuals and families.
		(2)	allow low-income individuals and families the ability to acquire a limited ownership interest in a building.
		(3)	participate, through the voting rights granted to each share owner, in the management of the limited equity cooperative, and
		(4)	restrict the annual appreciation of membership shares to increases not to exceed 10 percent of the original consideration paid for the share in order to provide appreciation for the share owner and continued affordability for other low-income households at resale;
	(b)	balance the interests of home ownership with the need to protect existing tenants from displacement;
	(c)	increase the availability of affordable home ownership opportunities citywide;
	(d)	target affordability levels that reflect the needs and income distribution of the City's residents; and
	(e)	improve the physical condition of the converted housing stock without fueling neighborhood gentrification.

SEC. 1399.2.  MODIFICATION TO EXISTING CODE.
	This Article modifies applicable provisions of the San Francisco Subdivision Code ("Code") for all conversion applications submitted under Section 1399.17. Article 9 of the Code does not apply to conversions to stock cooperatives under this Article except as expressly noted herein, but would apply in the event that a stock cooperative formed under this Article seeks to convert to a condominium. The provisions of Sections 1332(a), 1341 and 1385 of the Code do not apply to conversions under this Article. Subdivisions permitted by this Article shall not constitute an increase in the limits of Section 1396 for purposes of Sections 1341A(2) or 1385A(2).

If the Subdivider, after making a reasonably diligent search, cannot locate a tenant, the Subdivider shall document its efforts to reach the tenant and shall request a waiver from this subsection. MOH shall evaluate whether all reasonable measures have been taken to locate the tenant and, if it finds that they have, shall grant such a waiver.
		(5)	The Subdivider and the Mayor's Office of Housing have entered into a binding agreement to record a notice of special restrictions against the property as a condition of subdivision that imposes: (A) all requirements of California Business and Professions Code Section 11003.4(b)(3), (B) the resale restrictions set forth in Section 1399.21(C) Carrying Charge restrictions set forth in Section 1399.9, (D) subleasing restrictions set forth in Section 1399.6(b)(3), and (E) rent restrictions for Resident Tenants set forth in Section 1399.8A.

SEC. 1399.8A  TENANT LIFETIME LEASE RIGHTS.
	(a)	A lifetime lease arises as to each tenant who is qualified to purchase under Section 1399.8 but who has not exercised his or her right to do so on the date that the subdivision map for the property is recorded. In consideration of the benefit of this Article 11 to the Subdivider and any successors in interest from permitting the conversion of buildings of 2 units or more, the Subdivider and all successors in interest agree to waive any right to any rent increase other than as provided in this subsection that may be permitted by any other provision of law, and to waive any claim against the City of a taking under the California or United States Constitution based on the lifetime lease provision. These waivers will be binding on any heirs, successors in interest, or assigns.
	(b)	The initial rent payable under the lifetime lease shall not exceed the rent charged on the date the application for the Certificate of Clearance is submitted, plus ten (10) percent. Subsequent annual rent increases may not exceed the average annual percentage increase in Carrying Charges paid by all Resident Members. At no time may rent for a unit occupied by a Qualifying Household exceed the Maximum Annual Rent as defined herein. A tenant receiving a lifetime lease under this Section 1399.8A may exempt himself or herself from the restrictions on rent imposed by this limitation at any time if the tenant enters into an express agreement waiving the requirements of this subsection. A Subdivider or Limited Equity Housing Cooperative that is applying to or has converted under this ordinance may not evict a Resident Tenant based on his or her refusal to enter into such a waiver agreement. Any written waiver under this subsection 1399.8A(b) shall be invalid and unenforceable unless the following statement is printed in bold and all capital letters on the first line of the written waiver agreement:
REFUSAL TO ENTER INTO THIS WAIVER AGREEMENT WILL NOT TERMINATE YOUR RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO OCCUPY YOUR UNIT UNDER A LIFETIME LEASE WITH THE LIMITED EQUITY HOUSING COOPERATIVE. REFUSAL TO ENTER INTO THIS WAIVER AGREEMENT CANNOT BE USED AS A BASIS FOR EVICTING YOU.
	(c)	The lifetime lease shall contain a provision allowing the Resident Tenant to terminate the lease and vacate the unit upon thirty days written notice to the landlord.
	(d)	The lifetime lease shall terminate on the death of the Resident Tenant or the date on which the tenant ceases to actually and continuously reside in the unit as his or her sole residence, whichever occurs first. The landlord may terminate the lease during its term only for a Permitted Eviction.
	(e)	There shall be no decrease in maintenance of the unit occupied by a Resident Tenant under a lifetime lease.
	(f)	If, on the date the application packet as provided in Section 1399.17 is submitted, the tenant jointly occupies the unit with a person who is not a tenant or a Resident Member but who is a related party, then, at the request of the tenant, the related party shall become a tenant under the lifetime lease. A "related party" is an adult who is a grandparent, grandchild, parent, child, brother, sister, or spouse of the tenant, or person registered as a domestic partner of the tenant pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code 62.1-62.8, and who, for purposes of this ordinance, has occupied the unit for at least one year prior to the date of submission of the application for a Certificate of Clearance.
	(g)	A tenant's rights under a lifetime lease are not transferable, and any attempted transfer shall be of no force or effect. The foregoing does not prevent a Resident Tenant with a lifetime lease from allowing other persons to occupy the unit with him or her to the same extent as allowed Resident Members, provided that (i) the Resident Tenant continues to actually reside in the unit as his or her principal residence, and (ii) no other person residing in the unit who is not a party to the lifetime lease shall have the rights of a Resident Tenant. A Resident Tenant must provide the landlord with the name of each person who occupies the unit with the tenant as well as emergency contact information for that person in writing. The Resident Tenant must also give any other occupant of the unit a written notice that the occupant is not a tenant and has no rights under the lifetime lease.
	(h)	The Resident Member occupying a unit subject to a lifetime lease or his or her successor in interest may require a lifetime lease tenant to enter into a written agreement documenting the tenant's lifetime lease rights. The lifetime lease shall include the terms set forth in this Section and shall also include the terms of the existing written rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant to the extent those terms do not conflict with this Section. If there is no existing written rental agreement, the written agreement shall include the usual and customary terms of residential rental agreements in the City and County of San Francisco that do not conflict with the terms of this Section. Where the Resident Tenant has the right to use certain common areas of the property, as, for example, parking or storage, or the right to have pets, those rights shall be included in the written agreement.
	(i)	A Notice of Right to Lifetime Lease shall be in the following form, printed in 12 point type or larger:
NOTICE OF RIGHT TO LIFETIME LEASE
TO: (name of tenant)
RE: (address of unit)
This Notice of Right to Lifetime Lease is given to you as required by Section 1399.8A of the San Francisco Subdivision Code. If the property in which you live becomes a Limited Equity Housing Cooperative and you do not purchase a members share, you will have a lifetime lease.
A. The lifetime lease will start on the date that the subdivision map for the Limited Equity Housing Cooperative is recorded with the San Francisco Recorder. In consideration of the benefit of this Article 11 to the Subdivider and any successors in interest from permitting the conversion of buildings of 2 units or more, the Subdivider and all subsequent owners shall agree to waive any right to any rent increase other than as provided in Article 11 that may be permitted by any other provision of law, and to waive any claim against the City of a taking under the California or United States Constitution based on the lifetime lease provision. The waivers will be binding on any heirs, successors in interest, or assigns.
B. The following terms will be incorporated into your lifetime lease.
	1. The initial rent payable under the lifetime lease shall not exceed the rent charged on the date the application for the Certificate of Clearance is submitted, plus ten (10) percent. Subsequent annual rent increases may not exceed the average annual percentage increase in Carrying Charges paid by all Resident Members. At no time may rent for a unit occupied by a Qualifying Household exceed the Maximum Annual Rent as provided in the San Francisco Subdivision Code Section 1399.3.
	2. You have a right to terminate your lifetime lease at any time on thirty days prior written notice to your landlord.
	3. The lifetime lease automatically terminates only on the death of the last person named as a tenant in the lease or when you no longer actually and continuously reside in the unit as your sole place of residence.
	4. Your landlord may terminate the lifetime lease during its term only if:
		a. you fail to pay the rent to which the landlord is lawfully entitled under the oral or written agreement between you and the landlord or you habitually pay the rent late or give checks which are frequently returned because there are insufficient funds in the checking account;
		b. you have violated a lawful obligation or covenant of tenancy other than the obligation to surrender possession upon proper notice and you have failed to cure the violation after having received written notice of it from the landlord; provided that notwithstanding any lease provision to the contrary, your landlord shall not endeavor to recover possession of your unit as a result of your subletting the unit if your landlord has unreasonably withheld the right to sublet following a written request from you, so long as you continue to reside in the rental unit and the sublet constitutes a one-for-one replacement of the departing tenant(s) as set forth in Rent Board Regulations 6.15A(d) and 6.15B(b).
		c. you are committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in or are causing substantial damage to the rental unit, or you are creating a substantial interference with the comfort, safety or enjoyment of the landlord or tenants in the building;
		d. you are using or permitting the unit to be used for any illegal purpose;
		e. you have, after written notice to cease, refused the landlord access to the unit as required by state or local law; or
		f. you are a subtenant holding at the end of the term of an oral or written lease not approved by the landlord.
	5. If, on the date the application for conversion is submitted to the San Francisco Department of Public Works, one of the following persons lives with you at the unit and is an adult and who, for purposes of this ordinance, has occupied the unit for at least one year prior to the date of submission of the application for a Certificate of Clearance, at your request the landlord must name that person as a tenant on the lifetime lease, even if the landlord has not previously accepted that person as a tenant: your grandparent, grandchild, parent, child, brother, sister, spouse, or domestic partner.
	6. You may not assign or transfer the lifetime lease. However, you may allow other persons to occupy the unit with you to the same extent as allowed under the existing agreement between you and your landlord so long as you actually and continually reside in the unit as your sole place of residence and you give the landlord the name of each person who resides in the unit with you and emergency contact information for that person. You must give any person who resides in the unit with you notice that he or she is not a tenant and has no rights under the lifetime lease.
	7. At your landlord's request, you must enter into a written lease with your landlord that includes those terms of your existing rental agreement that do not conflict with your rights under the lifetime lease. If you do not have a written rental agreement, the written lifetime lease will contain provisions usually and customarily found in a residential rental agreement in San Francisco that do not conflict with your rights under the lifetime lease.

This section does not prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property where the sale, lease or financing is expressly conditioned upon the filing, approval and recordation of a Final or Parcel Map or where the SMA is inapplicable.
	(b)	All departments, officials and public employees of the City, City agencies or the agency vested with the duty or authority to approve or issue permits, shall act consistent with the provisions of this Code, the Plans and the Plan Documents and shall neither approve nor issue any permit or license for use, construction, or purpose in conflict with the provisions of this Code, the Plans and the Plan Documents.

The authority to deny a permit or approval shall apply whether the applicant was the owner of the real property at the time of the violation or whether the applicant is the current owner of the real property, with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of interest in the real property. Whenever the City has knowledge that property has been divided in violation of the provisions of the SMA or this Code, the Director shall process a notice of violation and meet and confer with the owner pursuant to SMA Section 66499.36.

In issuing a conditional certificate of compliance the Director may impose such conditions (including but not limited to filing an application for a corrected Tentative, Final or Parcel Map) as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired his or her interest therein, and which had been established at such time by this Code or the SMA. Where the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation of the provisions of this division or of local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto who by a grant of real property created a parcel or parcels in violation of this Code or the SMA, and that person is the current owner of record of one or more of the parcels which were created as a result of the grant on violation of this Code or the SMA, then the Director may impose any conditions which would have been applicable to a current division of the property.

	(b)	Subject to Section 1412.1, conditions may be required to be fulfilled before or after such filing of the related Final or Parcel Map. Where such conditions are to be fulfilled after filing of the related Final Map, the subdivider shall, where appropriate, enter into an improvement agreement and furnish security for compliance with those conditions including but not limited to security satisfying the requirements of California Government Code Section 66499, pursuant to the provisions of Article 6 and Article 8 of this Division.
	(c)	No conditions shall be imposed on a Tentative Map, Vesting Tentative Map or Parcel Map or improvement plans or improvement agreement that are not consistent with, exceed the limitations set forth in, or otherwise conflict with the Plans or Plan Documents.

Many of these improvement requirements will be required by specific, Mission Bay Project Area-wide levels of development. It is therefore possible that a Tentative Map or Parcel Map for a specific development proposal will trigger the requirement for Mission Bay Project Area- wide improvements, based on all development that has occurred to date in the Mission Bay Project Area. For purposes of the Subdivision Map Act, including, but not limited to, Government Code Section 66411.1, any such improvement requirements that are imposed as conditions upon a division of land shall be deemed to be reasonable offsite and onsite improvements for the parcels being created.

	(b)	The Director shall disapprove the proposed subdivision when the proposed subdivision is not consistent with the Plans, Plan Documents or General Plan, subject to any decision on appeal by the Board of Supervisors.
	(c)	When the Department of Planning or the Agency finds, subject to any decision on appeal by the Board of Supervisors, or when the Board of Supervisors finds, that a proposed subdivision will be consistent with the Plans, Plan Documents or General Plan only upon compliance with certain conditions, the Director shall incorporate said conditions in his or her conditional approval of the proposed subdivision.

SEC. 1433.  VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS.

SEC. 1433.3.  RIGHTS CONVEYED.
	(a)	Approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development as set forth in Chapter 4.5 of the SMA, Section 66498.1 et seq.

SEC. 1603.  SCOPE.
	(a)	This Code supplements SMA, prescribing rules, regulations and procedures authorized therein.
	(b)	The necessity for Tentative Maps, Final Maps and Parcel Maps shall be governed by this Section and SMA.
	(c)	For subdivisions creating five or more parcels or units, a Tentative Map and a Final Map shall be required pursuant to this Code and SMA.

		(2)	A Tentative Map and a Parcel Map shall be required for all subdivisions coming within the exceptions set forth in Section 66426 of SMA. 
	(d)	For subdivisions creating fewer than five parcels or units, no Tentative Map shall be required except as provided in Section 1633.1(a) for Vesting Tentative Maps and except where the Director deems a Tentative Map would be appropriate and the applicable City Regulations for the subject property would permit development at a density such that the subject property, or any portion thereof, may be resubdivided in a manner which would ultimately permit five or more parcels on the subject property. In all other subdivisions creating fewer than five parcels or units, a Parcel Map containing the information specified by Section 1659 of this Code and SMA shall be required.

SEC. 1604.  ENFORCEMENT.
	(a)	It is unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, partnership or association to offer or contract to sell, lease, finance, or construct any building for sale, lease or financing on any parcel or parcels of real property for which a Final Map or a Parcel Map is required unless and until a Final Map or Parcel Map in full compliance with the provisions of this Code and SMA, has been duly recorded in the office of the Recorder. This Section does not prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property where the sale, lease or financing is expressly conditioned upon the filing, approval and recordation of a Final or Parcel Map, where the SMA otherwise allows an offer or contract to sell, lease, or finance, or where the SMA is inapplicable.
	(b)	All departments, officials and public employees of the City, City Agencies or the agency vested with the duty or authority to approve or issue permits, shall act consistent with the provisions of this Code, the Plan, and the Plan Documents and shall neither approve nor issue any permit or license for use, construction, or purpose in conflict with the provisions of this Code, the Plan and the Plan Documents. Any such permit or license issued in conflict with the provisions of this Code, Plan and the Plan Documents shall be null and void. No conditions shall be imposed on or in connection with Tentative Maps, Vesting Tentative Maps, Parcel Maps or Final Maps, including improvements plans and Improvement Agreements, that conflict with the Plan and Plan Documents.

Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder. 
	(d)	The Director shall have the authority to enforce this Code against violations thereof in accordance with Chapter 7, Sections 66499.30 et seq. of the SMA. The City shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this Code or the SMA if it finds that development of the real property is contrary to the public health, safety or welfare. The authority to deny a permit or approval shall apply whether the Applicant was the owner of the real property at the time of the violation or whether the Applicant is the current owner of the real property, with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of interest in the real property. Whenever the City has knowledge that property has been divided in violation of the provisions of the SMA or this Code, the Director shall process a notice of violation and meet and confer with the owner pursuant to SMA Section 66499.36.

The Director shall forward the request to the City Attorney for review.
	(b)	Upon making a determination of compliance, the Director shall, in accordance with Section 66499.35 of the SMA, cause a certificate or conditional certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the County Recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division of land complies with applicable provisions of the City Regulations and the SMA. 
	(c)	A recorded Final or Parcel Map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
	(d)	If the Director determines that the real property does not comply with the provisions of this Code or the SMA the Director shall issue a conditional certificate of compliance. In issuing a conditional certificate of compliance the Director may impose such conditions (including but not limited to filing an application for a corrected Tentative, Final or Parcel Map) as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the Applicant acquired his or her interest therein, and which had been established at such time by this Code or the SMA. Where the Applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation of the provisions of this division or of local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto who by a grant of real property created a parcel or parcels in violation of this Code or the SMA, and that person is the current owner of record of one or more of the parcels which were created as a result of the grant on violation of this Code or the SMA, then the Director may impose any conditions which would have been applicable to a current division of the property.

SEC. 1605.  SEVERABILITY.
	(a)	If any Article, Section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code, or any part thereof, is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, or other competent agency, such decisions shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Code or any part thereof. The Board of Supervisors hereby declares that it would have passed each Article, Section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more Articles, Sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective.
	(b)	If the application of any provision or provisions of this Code to any person, property or circumstances is found to be unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, or other competent agency, the effect of such decision shall be limited to the person, property or circumstances immediately involved in the controversy and the application of any such provisions to other persons, properties and circumstances shall not be affected. 
	(c)	This Section shall apply to this Code as it now exists and as it may exist in the future, including all modifications thereof and additions and amendments thereto.

This Section does not prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property where the sale, lease or financing is expressly conditioned upon the filing, approval and recordation of a Final or Parcel Map, where the SMA otherwise allows an offer or contract to sell, lease, or finance, or where the SMA is inapplicable.
	(b)	All departments, officials and public employees of the City, City Agencies or the agency vested with the duty or authority to approve or issue permits, shall act consistent with the provisions of this Code the Project Documents and City Regulations, and shall neither approve nor issue any permit or license for use, construction, or purpose in conflict with the provisions of this Code, the Project Documents or City Regulations.

The City shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this Code or the SMA if it finds that development of the real property is contrary to the public health, safety or welfare. The authority to deny a permit or approval shall apply whether the Applicant was the owner of the real property at the time of the violation or whether the Applicant is the current owner of the real property, with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of interest in the real property. Whenever the City has knowledge that property has been divided in violation of the provisions of the SMA or this Code, the Director shall process a notice of violation and meet and confer with the owner pursuant to SMA Section 66499.36.

	(c)	A recorded Final or Parcel Map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein.
	(d)	If the Director determines that the real property does not comply with the provisions of this Code or the SMA the Director shall issue a conditional certificate of compliance.
