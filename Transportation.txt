PREFACE TO THE TRANSPORTATION CODE 
	Proposition A, titled "Transit Reform, Parking Regulation and Emissions Reductions," was adopted by the voters on November 7, 2007. Proposition A amended the San Francisco Charter to give the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency additional authority in several areas, such as approving contracts, hiring, setting employee pay rates and proposing revenue measures. Proposition A also expanded MTA power to adopt many parking and traffic regulations, and to install many traffic control devices that had previously required the approval of the Board of Supervisors. Proposition A provides that actions related to stop signs, bicycle lanes, preferential parking zones, parking meter zones, parking time limits, and disabled parking privileges may be reviewed by the Board of Supervisors if the Board of Supervisors enacts an ordinance establishing review procedures for those items. 
	Proposition A required the Board of Supervisors to enact implementing legislation within 90 days of its effective date to repeal all of the provisions of the Traffic Code that were inconsistent with Proposition A. Accordingly, Transportation Code Division I was passed by the Board of Supervisors on March 18, 2008, and approved by the Mayor on March 24, 2008 (see Ord. 45-08, File No. 080236). 
	Proposition A gave the Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors legislative authority to enact any parking and traffic regulations that are not preempted by state law or reserved to the Board of Supervisors. The Municipal Transportation Agency took advantage of this opportunity to update the parking and traffic laws that had been initially enacted in 1940. Pursuant to the authority granted to it by Proposition A, the Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors enacted Division II of the Transportation Code on July 1, 2008 (see SFMTA Bd. Res. 08-120). Together, Divisions I and II make up the San Francisco Transportation Code, which took effect on July 2, 2008, and superseded the former Traffic Code in its entirety. 
	This electronic version of the City and County of San Francisco Municipal Code is updated as amending legislation is approved. New Ordinance Notices or New Resolution Notices are inserted where applicable to call the user's attention to material that has been affected by legislation that has been passed but is not yet effective. Any references to such legislation are also compiled in a table at the end of this Code. The amendments are then incorporated into the Code when they become effective.
	Beginning with legislation passed in 2011, all ordinances affecting this Code are summarized in a table that lists the identifying information (ordinance and file numbers), effective date, short title, and sections affected for each such ordinance. Beginning with the resolution passed April 5, 2011, SFMTA Resolutions affecting this Code are summarized in a similar table. Users should note that the operative date of an ordinance may be later than the effective date of the ordinance. A delayed operative date will be noted in the ordinance.
	This Code may contain various Editor's Notes (explaining the disposition of or cross referencing various provisions), and/or Codification Notes (documenting scrivener's errors and the like found in the underlying ordinances). Such notes have been inserted by the publisher for the convenience of the user or as historical references. They have not been approved or adopted by the City and County of San Francisco, and are of no legal force or effect.

SEC. 6.2.  REQUEST FOR PERMISSION FOR TEMPORARY USE OR OCCUPANCY OF PUBLIC STREETS; PROCEDURE.
	(a)	Any person seeking permission for the temporary use or occupancy of a public street within the City shall file an application with, and on a form provided by, the SFMTA, and shall pay the filing fee established by the SFMTA Board of Directors. 
	(b)	An application shall not be accepted or approved for a proposed temporary use or occupancy scheduled to occur fewer than 30 calendar days after the application is submitted to the Municipal Transportation Agency, except as follows in this paragraph: 
		(1)	An application for a proposed temporary use or occupancy scheduled to occur fewer than 30 calendar days after the application date may be filed for emergency consideration. The Director of Transportation shall consider the request if the applicant has demonstrated that an extraordinary emergency exists that requires the closing of a street, and provided that there is adequate time available for the Municipal Transportation Agency to conduct the required public hearing and post notice of the scheduled hearing at least 72 hours in advance of the hearing. 
		(2)	The Mayor's Film and Video Arts Commission (the "Film Commission"), or other successor commission or division of the Mayor's office, may file with the Director of Transportation an application on behalf of a film or other video production company (which company shall be responsible for the payment of all applicable fees) for a proposed temporary use or occupancy scheduled to occur fewer than 30 calendar days after the application date, provided that there is adequate time available for the Director of Transportation to conduct the required public hearing and post notice of the scheduled hearing at least 72 hours in advance of the hearing. The Film Commission (or the film company on whose behalf the application was made) shall (A) notify residents, merchants and other occupants of the public street(s) to be closed of the dates proposed for street closure, and (B) notify any and all affected City departments, including the Police Department and the Department of Public Works. 
	(c)	The completed application shall include, when applicable, maps and/or drawings which identify the streets that would be affected, describe the scope and design of the event, including illustrations of the location of staging, food booths, seating, and a diagram of an emergency access plan. In addition, the Director of Transportation may request such additional information as is necessary to allow ISCOTT to make an informed evaluation of the proposed temporary use or street occupancy. In the case of "major events," as defined in Section 6.3, applicants shall submit an emergency medical services plan. 
	(d)	Applicants shall be responsible for posting notice of the public hearing at least seven calendar days prior to the hearing at which the application will be reviewed by ISCOTT. Such notice shall include a description of the streets that would be affected and shall be posted in the area of the proposed temporary use or street occupancy according to rules and regulations prescribed by the Director of Transportation. The applicant shall submit a declaration under penalty of perjury to the Director of Transportation attesting that the required public notices have been posted. 
	(e)	ISCOTT Review and Approval Process. In reviewing an application, ISCOTT shall consider the impact of the temporary use or occupancy of public streets on the traffic, security, health, and safety of the public; determine the traffic, security, health, and safety requirements of the proposed temporary use or occupancy; and evaluate the measures proposed by the applicant to satisfy those requirements. For major events, ISCOTT shall forward the applicant's proposed emergency medical services plan to the Director of Emergency Medical Services and Emergency Operations Section (EMSEO). ISCOTT shall consider the recommendations of EMSEO regarding the proposed emergency medical services plan. It shall be the duty of ISCOTT to also consider the following: 
		(1)	Demonstrated ability of the applicant to comply with requirements necessary to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public, including compliance with the requirements of San Francisco Health Code Article 19L, "Prohibiting Smoking at Certain Outdoor Events."
		(2)	Duration of the temporary use or street occupancy and the City's ability to accommodate such use or occupancy with the necessary resources. 
		(3)	Overextension of the City's resources because of previously approved temporary use or occupancy of public streets or other activities that could cause scheduling conflicts during the same period. 
		(4)	The availability of an appropriate emergency access plan.
		(5)	The number of major events (as defined in Section 6.3 below) scheduled during the period for which the applicant seeks a permit, the nature and location of the major events, and the demand these major events will have on the City's resources, including its police, emergency and sanitation personnel. In considering the major events for which applications have been filed and/or approved. ISCOTT should give priority based on the chronological order in which the applications are received, and applicants denied permission on the basis that there are too many major events already approved or pending for approval shall be offered alternative dates by ISCOTT. Notwithstanding this provision, ISCOTT may, in its discretion, grant preference to recurring events traditionally or historically associated with a particular day or dates, provided that applications, once approved, cannot be revoked because of the subsequent filing of an application for a permit for an event traditionally or historically associated with a particular day or dates. 
		(6)	If the application is related to a filming project to be conducted by the applicant, ISCOTT shall notify the Film Commission (or other successor commission or division of the Mayor's office) and shall consider such conditions and criteria as the Film Commission shall attach to the application. 
	(f)	ISCOTT may impose additional requirements or conditions it deems necessary to protect the public interest by ensuring traffic management, security of property and health and safety of citizens. At the time ISCOTT reviews the application, it shall also determine the necessity of and the total estimated actual costs incurred by the Municipal Transportation Agency to run motor coaches to accommodate the rerouting of electrically powered transit vehicles because of restrictions that are imposed by the temporary street closing. The applicant shall pay a fee to the SFMTA based on the number of electrically powered vehicle hours per line affected. For purposes of this provision, "vehicle hour" shall mean the number of hours each coach on a line is in operation during the day of the street closing. If the application is approved, ISCOTT shall transmit to the applicant an invoice for the fee. The applicant shall make full payment of the fee no later than five days prior to the date of the street closing, or in accordance with a schedule agreed to by the Director of Transportation. ISCOTT shall not disapprove any application for a temporary use or occupancy of public streets because of the applicant's political, religious, or cultural orientation. 
	(g)	ISCOTT shall take action to approve or disapprove an application within 30 days of receipt of a complete application. Notice of ISCOTT's action of approval or disapproval shall be submitted to the Chief of Police; the Fire Chief; the Director of Public Health; the Director of Public Works; and the Executive Director of the Entertainment Commission, and be maintained as a matter of record. For major events, notice of ISCOTT's action of approval or disapproval shall also be submitted to the Director of EMSEO. 
	(h)	Appeals Process. Should the application be disapproved by ISCOTT, the applicant may first appeal the decision to the Director of Transportation if the application was filed at least 30 days prior to the date of the proposed temporary use or occupancy. Such appeal shall be made by filing the appeal with the Director of Transportation on a form provided by the Municipal Transportation Agency within five working days of disapproval. Upon receipt, the Director of Transportation shall set a time and place for hearing such appeal. In considering the appeal the Director of Transportation shall conduct a public hearing for which notice shall be posted at least 72 hours in advance of the hearing at the Municipal Transportation Agency, at the main library, and at the Office of the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors. 
	(i)	At the appeal hearing, the appellant and members of ISCOTT shall have an opportunity to present oral testimony and written materials in support of their positions. The Director of Transportation shall consider the same criteria as set forth in Section 6.2(e). Upon hearing the appeal, and after any further investigation by the Director of Transportation, the Director of Transportation may affirm, reverse, or modify the ISCOTT decision. Notice of the Director of Transportation's action of approval or disapproval shall be submitted to the Chief of Police, the Fire Chief, the Director of Public Health, the Director of Public Works, and the Executive Director of the Entertainment Commission and shall be maintained as a matter of record. 
	(j)	If the Director of Transportation denies the application after the appeal described in the preceding paragraph, the applicant may then appeal the decision to the Board of Supervisors. Such appeal shall be made by filing the appeal with the Clerk of the Board, on a form provided by the Clerk, within five working days of the Director of Transportation's disapproval. The Board may establish a fee to be imposed upon the filing of any such appeal. Upon receipt, the Clerk shall set a time and place for hearing such appeal by the Board of Supervisors, which hearing shall be at the Board's next regular meeting, provided that all applicable public notice requirements are satisfied. The Board shall conduct the hearing according to the same standards of review as set forth in Section 6.2(e). Upon hearing the appeal, and after any further investigation that the Board may request, the Board may affirm, reverse or modify the Director of Transportation's decision. The decision of the Board regarding the appeal shall be final. The Clerk of the Board shall transmit copies of any legislation approving a temporary street closing to the Director of Public Works, Chief of Police, the Fire Chief, the Superintendent of Emergency Hospital Service of the Department of Public Health, the Executive Director of the Entertainment Commission, and to the Director of Transportation. For major events, the Clerk shall transmit copies of any legislation approving a temporary street closing to the Director of EMSEO. 
	(k)	Any permission for the temporary use of occupancy of a public street authorized pursuant to these provisions shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 6.7 and 6.8. 
	(l)	Late Application. Should the applicant file an application for a proposed temporary use or occupancy fewer than 30 days prior to the date of the proposed use or occupancy, and not far enough in advance of the proposed use or occupancy to allow ISCOTT to consider the application at a regularly scheduled meeting of ISCOTT, then the Director of Transportation shall have the responsibility and duty to consider and approve or disapprove the application after consulting with the members of ISCOTT. The Director of Transportation shall conduct a public hearing for which notice shall be posted at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing at the Municipal Transportation Agency, the main library, and at the Office of the Clerk of The Board of Supervisors. At the hearing, the applicant and interested persons shall have an opportunity to present oral testimony and written materials in support of their position. The Director of Transportation shall conduct the hearing according to the same standards of review as set forth in Section 6.2(e) hereof. Notice of the Director of Transportation's action of approval or disapproval shall be submitted to the Chief of Police, the Chief of the Fire Department, the Director of Public Health, the Director of Public Works, and the Executive Director of the Entertainment Commission, and shall be maintained as a matter of record. In the event the Director of Transportation disapproves the application, the applicant shall have the right to appeal the Director of Transportation's decision to the Board of Supervisors in accordance with the same terms and conditions as set forth in Section 6.2(e).

(Amended by Ord. 287-08, File No. 081340, App. 12/5/2008)
SEC. 6.5.  RECYCLING, COLLECTION AND DISPOSITION.
	(a)	Recycling Plan. Any applicant seeking permission for the temporary use or occupancy of a public street, a street fair or an athletic event within the City for an activity or special event that includes dispensing of beverages from glass, aluminum, or plastic containers, or which causes to be generated large amounts of other recyclable materials, shall be required to submit a plan demonstrating a good-faith effort to provide a method to separate glass, aluminum and plastic beverage containers or other materials for the purpose of recycling them. 
	(b)	Disposition of Recyclable Materials. Prior to the review by ISCOTT of such application, the applicant shall submit to the chair of ISCOTT the following information: 
		(1)	A plan that describes the number and location of source-separated recycling containers that are necessary to ensure convenient utilization and protect public health and safety; and 
		(2)	Documentation that collection services shall be performed by a private or nonprofit source.
	(c)	Collection of Recyclable Containers. At the time ISCOTT considers the application, it shall determine whether all of the necessary information has been submitted and whether the measures proposed by the applicant provide for the collection and disposition of source-separated materials. The applicant shall pay a deposit in the amount of $100, for each day of the event, to the Director of Public Works, at the time the application is filed, which shall be forfeited if applicant fails to collect recyclable materials and deposit said materials at a recycling facility. Such deposit shall be refunded in full to the permittee, by the Director of Public Works, upon receipt of documentation which verifies that the collected material was disposed at an appropriation recycling facility. 
	(d)	Past Performance. The Director of Public Works shall maintain records for a period of three years that document the recycling performance of the applicant when a temporary use of a public street is permitted. If an applicant for a temporary street closing, street fair or athletic event has been granted approval in the past pursuant to a permit issued by the City and County of San Francisco and failed to collect and dispose recyclable beverage containers, ISCOTT may require the applicant to pay a deposit in an amount greater than that normally required, so long as the increased amount is reasonably related to the anticipated costs of collecting and disposing of recyclable materials. However, if an applicant who has failed to comply with a recycling plan in the past has, since that occurrence, temporarily used a public street, or sponsored a street fair or athletic event pursuant to a permit and has complied with a recycling plan, the amount of the deposit normally required of applicants shall apply. 
	(e)	Rules and Regulations. The Director of Administrative Services shall promulgate any rules and regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and requirements of this Article. Before issuing or amending any rules or regulations, the Director of Administrative Services shall provide a 30-day public comment period by providing published notice in an official newspaper of general circulation in the City of the intent to issue or amend the regulations.

		(2)	"Sponsor" means that organization responsible for organizing a street fair and authorized to represent the street fair before City agencies and officials. 
		(3)	A "street fair" means a social or community event, not including an athletic event or parade, in which any group of persons convene to celebrate their community or neighborhood on any street in the City which event obstructs or interferes with the normal flow of vehicular traffic. 
	(b)	Applying for Temporary Use of Street for Street Fair. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code or the San Francisco Administrative Code, the regulation of street fairs, including the processes for obtaining permits from the City for conducting these street fairs and the payment of associated fees to the City, shall be governed by this Section. In order to provide for the safe, orderly and cost-effective conduct of street fairs, any organization seeking permission for the temporary use of a street for the purpose of conducting a street fair shall file an application with the Director of Transportation no later than 90 days prior to the proposed date for the event.

	(c)	Timeliness of Applications. No person submitting an application after the deadlines set forth in this Article shall be granted permission to conduct a street fair on the dates requested unless the person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of Transportation that the failure to submit a timely application was justified by extraordinary circumstances; provided, however, that in no event shall an applicant be permitted to file an application less than 60 days prior to the proposed date for the event. Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors may establish a late fee to be assessed for untimely filed applications. 
	(d)	Review of Application.

If the Director of Transportation determines that the applicant has failed to provide the information required, the Director of Transportation shall, within five business days of receiving the application, notify the applicant of what additional information is required. If the applicant fails to provide the additional information required within five business days of notification by the Director of Transportation, the application shall be deemed to be untimely filed; provided, however, that upon good cause shown, the Director of Transportation may extend this five-day period. Except as provided in Subsection (2) of this Section, the Director of Transportation shall transmit the completed application to ISCOTT. 
		(2)	If, upon reviewing the application, the Director of Transportation determines that the proposed street fair will be contained within one block in such a manner that no intersections will be closed, and that the proposed street fair will not require the rerouting of Municipal Railway vehicles, the Director of Transportation may grant the street fair permit without referring the application to ISCOTT; provided, however, that the Director of Transportation shall transmit copies of the applications to the constituent members of ISCOTT for informational purposes.

(Amended by Ord. 287-08, File No. 081340, App. 12/5/2008)
SEC. 6.11.  ATHLETIC EVENTS; DESIGNATION OF ROUTES.
	(a)	The increasing number of athletic events being held on City streets places a significant burden on the City and its inhabitants. Athletic events provide entertainment and recreation for San Franciscans and people throughout the Bay Area, as well as promoting and supporting tourism in the City. But closing off several major streets at the same time to accommodate a race often causes hardship in the daily lives of local residents, widespread disruption of public transit service, increased litter on public streets and sidewalks, and potential interference with emergency services. By adopting this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors intends to reconcile the City's interest in promoting athletic events with the right of its citizens to the quiet enjoyment of their own neighborhoods. 
	(b)	Athletic events requiring temporary street closings shall be limited in location to routes previously designated as appropriate by the Board of Supervisors. These routes shall be drawn up by ISCOTT and approved by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. In designating these routes, ISCOTT and the Board shall consider the effect of the designation upon: Local traffic patterns; Municipal Railway routes; the ability of the Police Department and the Department of Public Works to provide special services to the event; the safe and efficient delivery of police, fire and emergency medical services to the affected neighborhoods; the safety of participants in the event; and, the rights of participants, residents and local businesses to the reasonable use and enjoyment of City streets. 
	(c)	Any person seeking permission to conduct an athletic event as defined in Section 9.10 shall file an application. The filing of an application and its processing shall be governed by the same processes, application fees, appellate procedures, Municipal Railway fees, and other requirements contained in Section 9.2, which sets forth the procedures for requesting permission for temporary use or occupancy of public streets. A street closing for an athletic event shall be restricted to those routes designated pursuant to this Section. The applicant may, as part of the application, request a waiver of this restriction. In considering a request for a waiver, the City may take into account the extent to which the event has been held along a particular route prior to the application date if that same route has been in use continuously for a period of three or more years. An applicant's request for a waiver shall be granted to the extent that a change of route is required by the Police Department for reasons of public safety. 
(Amended by Ord. 287-08, File No. 081340, App. 12/5/2008)
SEC. 6.12.  ATHLETIC EVENTS; PUBLIC NOTICE.
	(a)	ISCOTT shall mail a copy of any application for a temporary street closing for an athletic event to any community group or neighborhood association that has previously requested in writing to be notified of such applications. 
	(b)	If the temporary street closing is approved, the applicant shall cause notices of the event to be conspicuously posted on both sides of the street along the entire route, at not more than 300 feet in distance apart on each street so posted, but not less than three notices on each street forming part of the route. The notices shall be posted not less than 72 hours prior to the scheduled start of the event. The applicant shall remove the notices within 48 hours after the completion of the event, or be liable for the costs of removal by the City pursuant to Article 10 of the San Francisco Police Code. 
	Each notice shall be headed "STREET CLOSED FOR ATHLETIC EVENT" in letters not less than one inch in height, and shall in legible characters (1) briefly describe the event to be held; (2) identify the date and time the event is to take place; and, (3) warn that the street will be closed to traffic at that time.

SEC. 6.13.  ATHLETIC EVENTS; COST RECOVERY  POLICE.
	(a)	An application for a temporary street closing for an athletic event shall be deemed a request for police department services within the meaning of Sections 10B.1 through 10B.5 of the San Francisco Administrative Code. If the temporary street closing is approved, the Chief of Police may detail such personnel to police the event in the number and for the period of time the Chief determines to be necessary to perform the services. If the on-site services of two or more police officers are required during the event, the applicant shall be liable for the cost of police services, including field investigation needed to determine manpower requirements, and shall be responsible for indemnifying and holding harmless the City and County of San Francisco and the police personnel as required by Section 10B.2.

If the deposit pursuant to Subsection (b) hereof is insufficient to cover the cost of police services, the Chief of Police shall notify the applicant by United States mail to the address listed on the application and the applicant shall have ten days to pay the balance. If the amount deposited exceeds the actual costs, the Chief of Police shall authorize a refund of the excess to the applicant at the address shown on the application.

If the temporary street closure is revoked, the money deposited for the costs of police services pursuant to this Article shall be refunded.

SEC. 6.14.  ATHLETIC EVENTS; COST RECOVERY  PUBLIC WORKS.
	(a)	An application for a temporary street closing for an athletic event shall be deemed a request for Department of Public Works services within the meaning of Sections 10B.11 through 10B.15 of the San Francisco Administrative Code. If the temporary street closing is approved, the Director of Public Works may detail such personnel to provide street-cleaning and related services for the event in the number and for the period of time the Director of Transportation determines to be necessary to perform the services. The applicant for the temporary street closing shall be liable for the cost of street-cleaning and related services, including field investigation needed to determine manpower requirements, and shall be responsible for indemnifying and holding harmless the City and County of San Francisco and the Department of Public Works personnel as required by Section 10B.12. 
	(b)	Upon approval of a temporary street closing for an athletic event, a sum of money which the Director of Public Works estimates will be necessary to cover the costs of services pursuant to Section 10B.12 of the Administrative Code shall be due. No approval shall be deemed effective until such sum of money is deposited with the Director of Public Works. The sum of money required pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited at least one calendar week before the scheduled event. If the applicant does not deposit the sum required within the time limit specified, the application for a temporary street closing shall be deemed denied, or, if the street closing has already been approved, revoked. The Director of Public Works may waive the advance deposit requirement if the particular event has not required additional street-cleaning or related services for the past three years. The applicant shall, however, remain liable for the costs of any additional services actually required. 
	(c)	Within a reasonable time after the event is over, the Director of Public Works shall determine the amount of money necessary to cover the cost of services provided by the Department of Public Works pursuant to Section 10B.12 of the Administrative Code. If the deposit pursuant to Subsection (b) hereof is insufficient to cover the cost of street-cleaning and related services, the Director of Public Works shall notify the applicant by United States mail to the address listed on the application and he or she shall have ten days to pay the balance. If the amount deposited exceeds the actual costs, the Director of Public Works shall authorize a refund of the excess to the applicant at the address shown on the application. 
	(d)	If the Board of Supervisors has approved a temporary street closing for an athletic event and the applicant cancels the event after personnel have been assigned to provide street-cleaning and related services to the event and such personnel have begun that duty, the applicant shall be liable for the time expended by Department of Public Works personnel pursuant to Section 10B.12 of the San Francisco Administrative Code. If a temporary street closing is revoked, the money deposited for the costs of street-cleaning and related services pursuant to this Article shall be refunded.

	(a)	This Section shall govern the imposition, assessment and collection of administrative penalties imposed pursuant to Section 314.
	(b)	The SFMTA Board of Directors finds:
		(1)	That it is in the best interest of the City, its residents, visitors and those who park on City streets to provide an alternative, administrative penalty mechanism for enforcement of Residential Parking Permit applications that contain false, misleading, or fraudulent information in addition to the existing enforcement mechanisms authorized under the San Francisco Transportation Code; and
		(2)	That the administrative penalty scheme established by this section is intended to compensate the public for the injury or damage caused by any person who submits a Residential Parking Permit application containing a fraudulent statement in order to obtain preferential parking in a Residential Parking Permit Area. The administrative penalties authorized under this section are intended to be reasonable and not disproportionate to the damage or injury to the City and the public caused by the prohibited conduct.
	(c)	Administrative Citation. Where an officer or employee designated in Section 314 determines that there has been a violation of subdivision (b) of Division I, Section 7.2.50, the officer or employee may issue an administrative citation to the person and/or entity responsible for the violation. The citation may be personally served on the applicant or by certified U.S. mail to the address indicated on the permit application. The citation shall inform the person or entity responsible of the date and nature of the violation and the amount of the administrative penalty, and shall state that the penalty is due and payable to the SFMTA within 15 business days from the date of the notice, if not contested within the time period specified. The citation shall also state that the person or entity responsible has the right, pursuant to Subsection (d), to request an administrative hearing of the citing officer or employee's determination as to the violation and assessment of penalties, and shall set forth the procedure for requesting an administrative hearing. The designated officer or employee shall mail the administrative citation and evidence supporting the determination of a violation of subdivision (b) of Division I, Section 7.2.50 to the residential address listed on the Residential Parking Permit application submitted to the SFMTA pursuant to Section 905.

		(1)	A person or entity that has been issued an administrative citation may request an administrative hearing in person, by telephone, or by email in order to contest the citation issued in accordance with this Section. The administrative hearing shall be initiated by filing a request for an administrative hearing with the SFMTA Hearing Division within 15 business days from the date of the citation. Failure to request a hearing in a timely manner or to attend a scheduled hearing shall satisfy the hearing requirement.
		(2)	Whenever an administrative hearing is requested pursuant to this Section, the SFMTA Hearing Section shall, within fifteen business days of receipt of the request, notify the requestor of the date, time, and place of the administrative hearing by certified mail. Such hearing shall be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the SFMTA Hearing Section receives the request, unless time is extended by mutual agreement of the affected parties.
		(3)	The administrative hearing shall be conducted by a neutral Hearing Officer assigned by the SFMTA Hearing Section. The SFMTA Hearing Section may issue rules as needed to implement this requirement. The parties may present evidence and testimony to the Hearing Officer. All testimony shall be under oath. The Hearing Officer shall ensure that a record of the proceedings is maintained. The burden of proof to uphold the violation shall be on the City, but the administrative citation shall be prima facie evidence of the violation.
		(4)	The Hearing Officer shall issue a decision including a summary of the issues and the evidence presented, and findings and conclusions, within fifteen (15) business days of the conclusion of the hearing. The Hearing Officer may uphold the penalty imposed by the citation or dismiss the citation. A copy of the decision may be personally delivered to the person contesting the violation or sent by first class mail. The decision shall be a final administrative determination. An aggrieved party may seek judicial review of the decision pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6.
	(e)	Payment and Collection of Penalty.
		(1)	Where a person has not made a timely request for administrative hearing, the penalty shall be due and payable to the SFMTA on or before 15 business days from the date of issuance.
		(2)	Where a person or entity has made a timely request for administrative hearing, and the violation and penalty have been upheld upon review, the administrative penalty shall be due and payable not later than 10 business days from the date of the notice of decision issued under subparagraph (d)(4).
		(3)	If a penalty due and payable under paragraphs (1) or (2) remains unpaid after the specified due date, the SFMTA shall send the violator written notice that the penalty is overdue. Penalties that remain unpaid 30 calendar days after the due date shall be subject to a late payment penalty of fifty ($50) dollars. Persons and entities against whom administrative penalties are imposed shall also be liable for the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the SFMTA in bringing any civil action to enforce the provisions of this section, including obtaining a judgment for the amount of the administrative penalty and other costs and charges.
		(4)	Where there is a nexus between the violation and property in the City owned by the violator, the SFMTA shall further inform the violator that if the amount due is not paid within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice, the SFMTA shall initiate proceedings to make the amount due and all additional authorized costs and charges, including attorneys fees, a lien on the property. Such liens shall be imposed in accordance with Chapter 10, Article XX of the Administrative Code.
	(f)	Administrative penalties shall be deposited in the Municipal Transportation Fund and may be expended only by the SFMTA.

SEC. 1104.  ELIGIBILITY.
	(a)	Determination of Eligibility. Each application shall be investigated by the SFMTA to determine the applicant's eligibility pursuant to the factors listed herein. The SFMTA, in determining whether the permit should be granted, may consider such facts as it deems pertinent, but shall at least consider the following factors: 
		(1)	The applicant's compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations. If, during the five years prior to application, an applicant has violated any statute, ordinance or regulation which would be a basis for revocation of the permit, the SFMTA may, in its discretion, refuse to issue the permit. 
		(2)	The record of the applicant for the preceding five years with regard to any other permits issued for the commercial operation of a motor vehicle for the transport of passengers, either in the City or elsewhere. 
		(3)	Any prior convictions of a crime that would, in the judgment of the SFMTA, present a risk to public safety if a permit is granted, including but not limited to convictions involving sexual assault, the use of a vehicle in the commission of a felony, fraud, violence against a person, reckless disregard for public safety, two or more recent convictions of drug-related offenses, or two or more recent convictions of driving under the influence, whether or not such convictions occurred while driving a Motor Vehicle for Hire. The SFMTA may, in its discretion, issue a permit notwithstanding prior convictions if, following review of an individual case, it determines that the applicant or Permit Holder does not pose a current risk to public safety. 
	(b)	Burden of Proof on Applicant. A permit applicant shall have the burden of proving that the applicant meets all requirements for a permit.

This requirement of Full-time Driving for four of five consecutive years may only be satisfied by driving a Taxi or Ramp Taxi for which a permit has been issued by the SFMTA. Paper waybills completed in compliance with Section 1109(c)(5), electronic trip data, or other corroborating documentary evidence, may be used to establish eligibility for a Medallion for the purposes of this Section.

		(6)	Partial Years. During the year that a Medallion is first issued or any year in which operation of the Medallion was temporarily suspended with the approval of the SFMTA in accordance with Section 1105(9)1, the number of driving hours required to meet the Full-Time Driving Requirement shall be reduced by the same proportion as the ratio of the Permit Holder's excused driving hours to the hours remaining in the calendar year.

The Statement of Work shall be signed under penalty of perjury by both the Color Scheme and the Medallion Holder designated as Key Personnel. The Color Scheme shall be responsible for submitting proof of employment with the Statement of Work, which shall consist of state or federal tax forms filed with the appropriate regulatory agency.

SEC. 1110.  CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO RAMP TAXI MEDALLIONS.
	In addition to the conditions specified in Section 1105, the following conditions are applicable to Ramp Taxi Medallion Holders: 
	(a)	Serving Passengers Who Use Wheelchairs.
		(1)	Ramp Taxi Medallion Holders shall grant priority to requests for service from passengers who use wheelchairs, and may not accept any other service request while en route to a dispatched call from a person who uses a wheelchair. In the absence of a request for service to a passenger who uses a wheelchair, a Ramp Taxi may transport any person.
		(2)	A Ramp Taxi Medallion Holder must ensure that any person who is allowed to drive the Ramp Taxi holds a valid Driver Permit and satisfies the training requirement of Section 1104(d)(3).
		(3)	Every Ramp Taxi Medallion Holder, and every Color Scheme that operates a Ramp Taxi Medallion pursuant to a use agreement with the SFMTA, must ensure that the operation of the Ramp Taxi makes at least eight wheelchair pick-ups per month, at least six of which must be customers of the Paratransit Program as established by reports of usage of San Francisco Paratransit Debit Cards. If a Ramp Taxi Medallion Holder fails to meet this requirement three times within a six-month period, the Ramp Taxi Medallion shall be suspended for a period of 90 days, and the Lease payment from the Color Scheme shall be paid into the Drivers Fund during the term of the suspension. If a Color Scheme that operates a Ramp Taxi Medallion pursuant to a use agreement with the SFMTA fails to meet the wheelchair pick-up requirement three times within a six-month period, or fails to comply with any material term of the Ramp Taxi medallion use agreement, the SFMTA may reassign the Ramp Taxi Medallion to another Color Scheme.
	(b)	Approval of Use of Ramp Taxi Medallion in Spare Taxi Vehicle. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law or of this Article, the SFMTA may allow a Ramp Taxi Medallion to be used for the purpose of operating a Taxi upon written request from a Color Scheme. The SFMTA may only approve such request if all of the following requirements are met: 
		(1)	The Taxi must be a spare vehicle approved by the SFMTA;
		(2)	The Taxi must meet all requirements for operation;
		(3)	The Ramp Taxi Medallion cannot be used in the Medallion Holder's Ramp Taxi because that vehicle is out of service or must be replaced; 
		(4)	The Ramp Taxi Medallion cannot be used in a spare Ramp Taxi because none are available at the Color Scheme with which the Ramp Taxi Medallion is affiliated; 
	(c)	Time Limits on Use of Ramp Taxi Medallion in Spare Taxi. A Ramp Taxi Medallion may be used in a spare Taxi for the lesser of the time that it would take to repair the Ramp Taxi or 30 consecutive days. Upon a showing of good cause, the SFMTA may extend the time limit beyond 30 days in increments of no greater than 15 consecutive days. In no event shall the total time in which a Ramp Taxi Medallion is used in a spare Taxi exceed 90 days within a 12 month period. The authorization to use the Ramp Taxi Medallion in a spare Taxi shall expire by operation of law on the day that the applicable time limit has been reached, or upon completion of repair or replacement of the Ramp Taxi, whichever occurs first. 
	(d)	If a Gas and Gates Ramp Taxi Medallion is returned to the SFMTA for any reason, the SFMTA shall allow the Color Scheme with which the Ramp Taxi Medallion is affiliated to operate the Ramp Taxi Medallion as a Gas and Gates Medallion for the remaining life of the Ramp Taxi vehicle, but only if the SFMTA determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Color Scheme has a record of satisfactory service to passengers who use wheelchairs. If the SFMTA determines that the Color Scheme with which the vehicle is affiliated has not provided satisfactory service to passengers who use wheelchairs, if the returned Ramp Taxi was not operated as a Gas and Gates Medallion, or upon expiration of the Ramp Taxi vehicle's useful life, the SFMTA may allow a Color Scheme of its choosing to operate the Ramp Taxi Medallion upon a determination that the Color Scheme has a record of exemplary service to passengers who use wheelchairs. A Color Scheme may operate a Ramp Taxi Medallion only pursuant to a use agreement with the SFMTA that requires the Color Scheme to make a monthly payment of $1500 to the SFMTA. The SFMTA shall deposit $100 of any such monthly payment into the Driver Fund.

SEC. 1115.  DETERMINATION OF NUMBER OF PERMITS.
	The SFMTA Board will from time to time but no more than once per 12-month period, hold a hearing to determine whether to limit the number of a class of permits to be issued and/or whether to issue new permits, and, if so, the limit on the number of a class of permits or the number of permits to be issued for each class of permits for the upcoming 12-month period. In making this determination, the Board will consider the availability of service provided by each class of permit compared to the demand for that service, and the public interest.

			(A)	Any Medallion Holder, except a Ramp Taxi Medallion Holder or a Single Operator Part-time Taxi Medallion Holder, who has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the SFMTA that he or she has a bona fide disability that permanently prevents him or her from satisfying the Full-Time Driving requirement, whether or not he or she is subject to the Full-Time Driving Requirement, or
			(B)	Any Medallion Holder, except a Ramp Taxi Medallion Holder or a Single Operator Part-time Taxi Medallion Holder, who has attained the age of 60.
		(2)	A Medallion Holder who is subject to the Full Time Driving Requirement must demonstrate that, as of the date that the Medallion is surrendered, he or she has been a Full Time Driver for four of five consecutive calendar years within the meaning of Section 1104(c)(3).
		(3)	No Medallion Holder against whom the SFMTA has filed a Notice of Violation, Notice of Summary Suspension, or Notice of Nonrenewal prior to completion of the surrender is eligible to surrender his or her Medallion for consideration until any resultant administrative hearing, administrative appeal, or court proceeding is concluded and the Medallion Holder has served any term of suspension imposed and paid any administrative fine imposed. In the event that the Notice of Violation seeks revocation of the Medallion, the Medallion Holder is not eligible to surrender the Medallion for consideration unless and until the administrative hearing and any resultant administrative appeal or court proceeding is concluded upon a determination that the Medallion will not be revoked.
		(4)	This Section does not confer on a Medallion Holder a vested right to surrender a Medallion for consideration. The SFMTA Board of Directors may decide at any time that the Medallion Transfer Program is terminated, suspended or otherwise not operational, and that no further surrenders by Medallion Holders eligible under this Section 1116 are permitted.
	(b)	Medallion Surrender Payment. As consideration for surrender of a Medallion in accordance with this Section, the SFMTA shall make a Medallion Surrender Payment in the amount of $200,000 to the Medallion Holder.
	(c)	Qualified Medallion Transferees. Upon surrender, the SFMTA may transfer the Surrendered Medallion under the Taxi Medallion Transfer Program to a Transferee who acknowledges and agrees that the Transferable Medallion is subject to the provisions of this Section. The SFMTA shall make offers of Initial Transfer to such Transferees in the order of seniority on the Waiting List, and then in the order of A-Card Seniority.
	(d)	Retransfer. 
		(1)	A Medallion that was subject to an Initial Transfer under the Taxi Medallion Sales Pilot Program or the Medallion Transfer Program is a Transferable Medallion, and the Transferee is eligible to Retransfer the Transferable Medallion at any time in accordance with this Section, regardless of age or disability status. The Transferee may not convey the Transferable Medallion by gift, bequest or in any manner other than by a bona fide Retransfer in accordance with this Section.
		(2)	In all instances in which Retransfer of a Medallion is allowed under this Section, the SFMTA may elect to purchase the Medallion from the Medallion Holder instead of allowing the Medallion Holder to Retransfer the Medallion.
		(3)	If the SFMTA chooses at any time to prohibit the future Retransfer of Transferable Medallions, it shall, at the request of a Medallion Holder who holds a Transferable Medallion, and upon ten days notice to a Qualified Lender who has a security interest in the Transferable Medallion, purchase the Medallion at the Medallion Transfer Price paid by the Medallion Holder. At the request of a Qualified Lender who has complied with the requirements of Section 1116(l) of this Article, the SFMTA will deduct from the payment made to any Medallion Holder under this Section 1116(d)(3) an amount sufficient to satisfy any outstanding balance on a loan made by the Qualified Lender and secured by an interest in the Medallion, and shall immediately remit that amount to the Qualified Lender. Upon receipt of this amount, the Qualified Lender shall comply with Section 1116(l)(3) and release its security interest in the Medallion.

The Director of Transportation may reset the Medallion Transfer Price based upon his or her determination that commercially relevant factors, including but not limited to the commercial loan terms available to Medallion applicants, the affordability of the monthly payments under such loans, and the anticipated business revenue to be generated from a Medallion, warrant resetting the Price. The Director of Transportation shall present his or her recommendation for a new Medallion Transfer Price to the SFMTA Board for approval. The Director of Transportation may adjust the Medallion Transfer Price without SFMTA Board approval no more frequently than annually in accordance with the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners for the San Francisco Bay Area has increased since the Medallion Transfer Price was last set or adjusted.

Transfers made at the Reduced Medallion Transfer Price shall be made in the order of seniority on the Waiting List, and shall be made in accordance with and subject to the requirements of this Code. After completing the transfer of 200 Medallions at the reduced Medallion Transfer Price, the SFMTA shall transfer Medallions that are returned to the SFMTA for any reason to Transferees at the Medallion Transfer Price. Upon authorization of the SFMTA Board, the SFMTA may transfer newly-issued Medallions to Transferees at the Medallion Transfer Price, or may transfer newly-issued Medallions to Transferees at the Reduced Transfer Price in order to complete the transfer of 200 medallions at that price.
	(h)	Taxi Medallion Retransfer Procedures.

		(2)	A Qualified Lender must be a financial institution chartered by a state government or the federal government, and may not impose any penalties or otherwise constrain the payment of the balance owed on the loan prior to the expiration of the loan term. The Director of Transportation may adopt rules setting forth additional requirements for designation by the SFMTA as a Qualified Lender.

The SFMTA will not recognize any security interest in a Transferable Medallion that is not filed and reported in compliance with this rule.
		(3)	Release of Secured Interest. Upon repayment of the loan secured by an interest in a Transferable Medallion, the Qualified Lender must file notice of release of the secured interest within five business days of the release with the SFMTA along with any underlying contracts or documents memorializing the terms and conditions of the release. 
	(m)	Foreclosure and Retransfer of Transferable Medallions.
		(1)	Foreclosure. If the Transferee defaults under the agreement with the Qualified Lender beyond any applicable notice and cure period, notwithstanding any other provisions herein to the contrary, the Qualified Lender may foreclose upon its security interest and possess the foreclosed, Transferable Medallion as an owner of the Transferable Medallion with full right, title, and interest thereto, except that Lender shall not be permitted to operate the Medallion.

Provided that the Qualified Lender has provided notice to the SFMTA under Section 1116(m)(1), upon foreclosure in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the security agreement between the Qualified Lender and the Medallion Holder, the Qualified Lender shall Retransfer the Transferable Medallion pursuant to the provisions of this Section to the Transferee identified by the SFMTA at the Medallion Transfer Price. The proceeds of such Retransfer sale shall be distributed first to the Qualified Lender to satisfy, to the extent possible, the Medallion Holder's debt to the Qualified Lender as determined by reference to the unpaid balance under the loan agreement between the Medallion Holder and the Qualified Lender. Any remaining proceeds shall be distributed to the SFMTA. The SFMTA shall use such proceeds to satisfy the Medallion Transfer Allocation and Driver Fund Retransfer Contributions, and shall deposit any additional funds into the Drivers Fund.
		(3)	Continued Operation After Foreclosure. Upon foreclosure and until Retransfer of the Transferable Medallion, the Qualified Lender shall require the Participating Color Scheme with which the Medallion is affiliated to continue to operate the Medallion.

The proceeds of any Retransfer of a Transferable Medallion that has expired due to revocation of the Medallion or death of the Medallion Holder shall be distributed first to the Qualified Lender, if any, to satisfy, to the extent possible, the Medallion Holder's debt to the Qualified Lender as determined by reference to the unpaid balance under the loan agreement between the Medallion Holder and the Qualified Lender. The remaining proceeds shall be distributed to the SFMTA to pay the applicable Medallion Transfer Allocation and the applicable Driver Fund Retransfer Contribution. Any proceeds remaining after the required distributions to the Qualified Lender and the SFMTA shall be disbursed to the former Medallion Holder or his or her designees.
		(3)	Other Disposition of the Medallion. If the SFMTA elects not to Retransfer the Transferable Medallion, the SFMTA must nevertheless satisfy any outstanding balance on a loan secured by a Qualified Lender, and must pay to the designees of a deceased Medallion Holder the equity accrued in the Transferable Medallion. Such equity shall consist of the current Medallion Transfer Price, minus the outstanding balance on any loan made by a Qualified Lender who has complied with Section 1116(l) to finance or refinance the Transfer or Retransfer of the Medallion, and minus the applicable Medallion Transfer Allocation and applicable Driver Fund Retransfer Contribution.
		(4) 	Continued Operation After Revocation or Death of the Medallion Holder.
